Skittlez final entry 

100 Proof: The Whole Story

Before the Night

Almost a year before this, Skittlez had finally gotten housing\. A door, a key, four walls—fragile peace after too long outside\. Me? I had what I always have: a backpack, a heartbeat, and my word\. Then the bottom started giving out under her—paperwork, pressure, whatever gears grind good things down—and they were kicking her out\.

I didn’t have a place to offer, but I had loyalty\. I traded a friend for his tent so she’d have somewhere to land if the floor dropped\. That’s my lane\. I’m the Shadow Knight—not the sun, not the headline, not the first call\. I’m the last resort who shows up when the lights go cold\.

The Call

Fast\-forward to that night\. She was on one side of town; I was on the other, worn from the grind\. I had Diamond—her dog—rolling with me\. She hit me:

“Meet me at McDonald’s\.”

Say less\. We grabbed the bus\. Long day for both of us, the kind that makes your bones feel like they’re filled with sand\.

When we walked in, Skittlez was… different\. Usually it’s hugs, smiles, that quick spark that says “we’re still us\.” But this time there was a steady glow, a focus in her eyes\. She slid a notepad across the table—handwritten notes from a tarot reading\.

The Cards \(And the Decode\)

Tarot ain’t my lane\. I don’t romanticize signs; I count steps, carry weight, handle what’s in front of me\. But she asked what I thought, so I fed it to ChatGPT to decode the symbols, the pentacles, the wands, the whole spread\.

Her takeaway was simple and loud: “It says we should go to San Francisco\.”

Me? If someone says, “You tryna roll?” I’m already lacing up\. Right now\. That’s my default—ready to move, ready to bounce, ready to breathe new air\. But being real: with her, there are always moving parts—loose ends, people, bags, plans\. We’ve had versions of “let’s get the hell outta here” before\. Life grabbed her ankle each time\.

Where We Come From

Most of the time I’ve known her, we’ve been camped in creek beds, tucked on county land, hidden corners where you count the days until a badge tells you to move along\. I’m minimalist by design—survive on less than I need\. Skittlez is the opposite: she lives big, loves big, hauls big—energy, history, belongings, the whole load\. Filling the “man role” in her world is labor\. Truth? I missed it\. I missed us as campmates\. Missed solving problems side by side, building a life out of nothing but will\.

The Shift

Now here’s the part that matters most\. This was the first night since—hell, maybe three months before her boyfriend got out, and definitely since he got out—that she let me give her real affection\. Not tension, not memory, not almosts\. Affection\. Intimacy\. I walked her out later, and I was high on nothing but closeness\.

That’s what I’m after: laying next to her, brushing her hair back with my hand, softly kissing the back of her neck\. Out here, sex is easy\. You can trip and fall into it\. Intimacy isn’t\. Intimacy is almost mythical—endangered\. And for it to be her? Man\. That hit like sunrise after a month of rain\.

The Morning After

Next morning, I walked her partway to where she was going\. The people she was meeting don’t like extras around, so I peeled off before the spot\. On the way back, I couldn’t shake her\. Dazed\. Confused\. Like I’d been spun through a wind tunnel and set down two inches to the left of reality\. Every step hummed with her\.

Who She Is \(Unapologetic\)

Skittlez ain’t the girl you take home to mom\. She’s a retired stripper, and no amount of soap scrubs the story out of skin like that\. I’m grateful it doesn’t\. There’s a perfect dose of trashy and tender she carries that’ll ruin you in the best way—lethal in spades\. People who judge never carried what she’s carried\. I’ve seen the steel under the glitter\. That’s the part that gets me\.

The Song Sparks

Back at McDonald’s, under those dumb\-bright lights, the notepad, the dog at our feet, the San Francisco “maybe,” the bus ride, the long day, the breath on her neck, the way she finally let me in again—it all braided into a rhythm\. I could hear the beat before the beat existed: dark trap, heavy 808s, eerie piano\. Vocals sharp always, no mud, no mumble\. A hook that felt like truth without a chaser:

“Fucked up fate got us tangled, you and me,

But I’m done with the fake—let’s be who we’re meant to be\.

When I hold you close, I’m searchin’ for truth,

Love with no bullshit, straight passion—that’s 100 proof\.”

That wasn’t written; it arrived\. Call it fate, call it muscle memory of two people who kept almost leaving and almost staying\.

Why It’s 100 Proof

Because that night was uncut\. No mixer, no mask\. Straight to the vein\. It wasn’t about a bed; it was about a bridge—from the creek beds and move\-alongs to something we could maybe name if we stopped running for two seconds\. The tarot didn’t command us; it nudged\. The AI didn’t dictate; it translated\. The choice was—and is—ours\.

All Of It, On Record

Year prior: she got housing; pressure starts; eviction looming\.

Me: nothing but a backpack and a promise; traded for a tent so she wouldn’t be out there alone\.

Identity: I’m the Shadow Knight—last resort, guaranteed presence\.

That night: separate sides of town; long day; I’ve got Diamond; bus ride to McDonald’s\.

Her energy: different in a good way; focused, glowing\.

Notepad: tarot spread in her handwriting; I run it through ChatGPT; message reads like “go to San Francisco\.”

Pattern: I’m “ready right now”; she has things to tie up—history of almost\-bolting\.

Our past: camped in creek beds, county properties, waiting on the move\-along\.

Our dynamics: I’m minimalist; she’s maximal; being her man means heavy lifting—I missed it\.

The intimacy: first time since \(and around three months before\) her boyfriend got out that she let me close; not sex—better than sex\.

Walk\-back: escorted her partway; had to split because her people don’t like extra bodies; I’m floating on the return, dazed and confused\.

Who she is: retired stripper; unapologetic; perfect measure of wild you can’t wash off—I’m thankful for it\.

Birth of the song: all of it fused under fluorescent lights; I heard the beat; the hook arrived; 

100 Proof named itself\.

Without further adu…\.\.

\[Slow, haunting piano intro with deep 808s building in the background\]

100 Proof

\[Spoken Word Intro: Raw, like a confession\. Slow, eerie piano, low 808 hum\.\]

“Look… sex? That’s easy\. It’s everywhere out here\.

Ain’t gotta look hard to find someone tryna feel somethin’ for a night\.

But intimacy? Real, raw, unfiltered closeness?

Shit, that’s damn near extinct in these streets\.

You learn quick—trust is a currency most can’t afford\.

So you keep your guard up, keep it movin’,

Never let nobody get too close\.

But then there’s that one person… the one who makes you wonder—

What if I let my guard down?

What if I stop runnin’?

What if this ain’t just another moment that fades into the next?

Tonight, she let me in again… first time in months\.

First time since he got out\.

And I ain’t gon’ lie—

Layin’ next to her, fingers in her hair, lips on her skin,

My mind went places it don’t usually go\.

What would we feel like?

Not just for a night—

But for real?

\(Pause\. Beat kicks in\. The song begins\.\)

\[Intro: Spoken, confident\]

Sex easy, but real love? That’s like tryna catch smoke in the wind\.

But when I lay next to you… damn, I wonder\.

\[Verse 1: Gritty, steady flow\]

Layin’ next to you, brushin’ back your hair,

Soft lips on your neck, fingers tangled in the air\.

Ain’t no rush, nah, I savor every part,

Cuz in these streets, love’s a ghost with a hollow heart\.

Seen too much, trust don’t come with ease,

Most just run, leave ya soul on freeze\.

But you let me in—shit, I ain’t used to that,

So now I’m stuck here, wonderin’ where you at\.

\[Pre\-Chorus: Melodic, haunting echo\]

What would we feel like? What would it be?

A wildfire burnin’ or waves in the sea?

Would you let me stay, would you let me breathe?

Or we just shadows, lost in the breeze?

\[Hook: Chant\-like, deep tone\]

Fucked up fate got us tangled, you and me,

But I’m done with the fake—let’s be who we’re meant to be\.

When I hold you close, I’m searchin’ for truth,

Love with no bullshit, straight passion—that’s 100 proof\.

\[Verse 2: Harder delivery, emotion rising\]

Streetlights hum, my mind still caught in the heat,

Escorted you home, but my heart stay stuck in that seat\.

Ain’t just about touch, nah, this is more,

You the first in a long time I ain’t tryna ignore\.

You crave the thrill, I know that vibe,

Danger callin’ you like midnight tides\.

But if you dive, I’m divin’ too,

Ain’t no halfway, I’m all in for you\.

\[Pre\-Chorus: Melodic, layered harmonies\]

What would we feel like? What would it be?

A wildfire burnin’ or waves in the sea?

Would you let me stay, would you let me breathe?

Or we just shadows, lost in the breeze?

\[Hook: Chant\-like, deep tone\]

Fucked up fate got us tangled, you and me,

But I’m done with the fake—let’s be who we’re meant to be\.

When I hold you close, I’m searchin’ for truth,

Love with no bullshit, straight passion—that’s 100 proof\.

\[Bridge: Spoken, low tone\]

Damn… never thought I’d even want this\.

Street love ain’t safe, but maybe… just maybe…

\[Outro: Soft, fading vocals\]

What would we feel like? What would it be?

A wildfire burnin’ or waves in the sea?
