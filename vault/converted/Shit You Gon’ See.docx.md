# Shit You Gon’ See

__Music Direction:__ Gritty, lo\-fi hip hop with a distorted piano loop and a heavy "boom\-bap" kick\.

\[Intro: Sounds of a busy city street | ad\-libs: "Open your eyes, man\. It's all right there\. Look\."\] The neon is flickering, the truth is in the cracks\. Once you see the vision, there ain't no turning back\.

\[Verse 1: Gritty, conversational flow | ad\-libs: "Look at that," "Hidden in plain sight"\] Polished shoes stepping over the forgotten\. The fruit looks ripe but the core is feeling rotten\. Watch the way they pivot when the cameras start to blink\. It’s a long way down when you stop to take a drink\.

\[Pre\-Hook: Cinematic strings swell | ad\-libs: "Witness this"\] They hide the blueprints behind a velvet screen\. But I’m the one who’s seeing what’s behind the machine\.

\[Hook: Gritty, repetitive chant | ad\-libs: "Real talk," "Keep watching"\] That’s the shit you gon’ see when the lights go out\. That’s the shit you gon’ see what they’re talking about\. Don’t close your eyelids, don’t turn your head away\. The truth is a debt that you’re gonna have to pay\.

\[Outro: Spoken, tone: cold and knowing\] You can’t unsee the ghost once you’ve seen the haunting\. \[Sound cue: Distant police siren, abrupt cut\]
