Ryans final response\.

__Warrior's Creed: Unbroken__

\[Intro: Ominous, slow\-build synths, heartbeat bass\]

\(What if\.\.\. what if\.\.\. you call the flames? You stoke the heat\.\.\. but I don’t burn the same\.\.\.\)

\[Verse 1: Steady, sharp delivery, kick\-snare bounce\]

What if I walk through the fire unfazed?

What if the burns just fuel my rage?

What if the pain ain't a price but a phase?

Turn my scars to gold, flip the page\.

What if the dark don’t swallow me whole?

What if the heat just hardens my soul?

What if I dance on the edge of control,

Laugh in the face of the fate you stole?

\[Pre\-Chorus: Tension rising, hypnotic rhythm\]

What if I don’t kneel, don’t fold?

What if I wear the flames like gold?

Blisters form, but I don’t break,

You light the match, I take the stake\.

\[Hook: Hard\-hitting, anthemic, syncopated drums\]

I’d follow you to hell like a goddamn soldier,

Take every burn, every scar on my shoulders\.

Step in the fire, my fists won’t shake,

Turn to ash, still rise, still wake\.

You play games, but I play for keeps,

Pain ain’t poison—it fuels the beast\.

\[Verse 2: Rapid\-fire cadence, slicing through the beat\]

What if the puppet just cut the strings?

What if I laugh at the curse you bring?

What if the venom don’t kill, just sting?

And every cut makes my war drum sing?

What if the chains just sharpen my teeth?

What if the weight puts strength underneath?

What if I take what you made for grief,

Flip that shit to a masterpiece?

\[Pre\-Chorus: Call and response, building intensity\]

What if I don’t kneel, don’t fold?

What if I wear the flames like gold?

Blisters form, but I don’t break,

You light the match, I take the stake\.

\[Hook: Hard\-hitting, anthemic, syncopated drums\]

I’d follow you to hell like a goddamn soldier,

Take every burn, every scar on my shoulders\.

Step in the fire, my fists won’t shake,

Turn to ash, still rise, still wake\.

You play games, but I play for keeps,

Pain ain’t poison—it fuels the beast\.

\[Bridge: Dark, atmospheric, whispered echo\]

What if the fire been callin’ me home?

What if the struggle just sharpens the throne?

What if the dance with the devil’s my own?

What if the flames feel like skin on bone?

\[Final Hook: Triumphant, layered vocals, cinematic swell\]

I’d follow you to hell like a goddamn legend,

Broke every chain, turned pain into weapons\.

Step in the fire, my fists won’t shake,

Turn to ash, still rise, still wake\.

You play games, but I rewrite fate,

Pain ain't poison—it seals my name\.

\[Outro: Fading bass thumps, whispered defiance\]

\(What if\.\.\. what if\.\.\. but what if I don’t break, bitch?\)
