Songbird

Emily's poem to her mother, followed by my rebuttal 

One day I'll stand on green grass, Flowers in hand\. Tears on my face, from a life I never got to have\.

That day I'll lay to rest, more than your soul, I'll finally put down this fear I hold

That day I will no longer, hold these heavy walls\. That day I can love you without the consequence it holds\.

That day I'll be safe from what this world cruelly made you, That day I can love you like I have always longed to\.

That day Songbird\. will play in the background purple irises and Gerber daisies will completely surround you\.

I will curl up alone, with my face near your headstone\. For the first time feeling safe, with the mother I adored\.

That day my heart broken will no more be form That day I will know a mother's love, without any scom

And my version turned to a song

\-\-\-

\[Verse 1: Staccato Female Vocal, light piano and ambient tones\]

"One day I'll stand on green grass,

Flowers in hand\.

Tears on my face,

From a life I never got to have\."

\-\-\-

\[Verse 2: Staccato Female Vocal, gentle beat builds in\]

"That day I'll lay to rest,

More than your soul\.

I'll finally put down,

This fear I hold\."

\-\-\-

\[Chorus: Staccato Male Vocal, sharp strings and driving rhythm\]

"Emily, as you listen to this song,

Ask yourself: what if all the pain,

Forged me ready for you,

To be your rock, to be your anchor?"

\-\-\-

\[Verse 3: Staccato Female Vocal, rhythmic layers intensify\]

"That day I will no longer,

Hold these heavy walls\.

That day I can love you,

Without the consequence it holds\."

\-\-\-

\[Verse 4: Staccato Female Vocal, haunting tones with added percussion\]

"That day I'll be safe,

From what this world cruelly made you\.

That day I can love you,

Like I have always longed to\."

\-\-\-

\[Chorus: Staccato Male Vocal, swelling instrumental backing\]

"Emily, as you listen to this song,

Ask yourself: what if all the pain,

Forged me ready for you,

To be your rock, to be your anchor?"

\-\-\-

\[Bridge: Staccato Female Vocal, ethereal harmonies and pulsing rhythm\]

"That day Songbird will play,

In the background\.

Purple irises and daisies,

Will completely surround you\."

\-\-\-

\[Verse 5: Staccato Female Vocal, soft and introspective tone\]

"I will curl up alone,

With my face near your headstone\.

For the first time feeling safe,

With the mother I adored\."

\-\-\-

\[Outro: Staccato Female Vocal, fading piano and soft pads\]

"That day, my heart broken,

Will no more be torn\.

That day, I will know a mother’s love,

Without any scorn\."
