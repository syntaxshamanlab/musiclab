\[Street preacher\-style spoken word over a gritty, testimonial flow\]

Scars write the book

\[Deliberate spoken word: Sharp, aggressive rap\]

A Spark Ignites 

\(scars write the book\)

A Spark Ignites 

\(scars write the book\)

\[Intro: Spoken, low rumble under bass\]

It only took a moment, just a spark, Your presence hit, and pierced the silent dark\. A whole new song ripped itself from the silence, A visceral birth, just like us DEFIANT\!

\[Verse 1: Beat drops like it just kicked the door in\]

Walked in like a ghost, stranger in the flesh

But my soul felt known, like you saw through the mess

Cracked my ribcage, handed me truth on a plate

All it took was a moment—now it's too late

\[Refrain: Sharp, layered chant\]

No cap, \(no tassel\) no tassel, \(No cap\) no classroom crook

\[Echoing: the book\]

Scars write the, \(the book\) scars write the book

She said every cut you carry, don't overlook

Read it out loud, make the world take a look

\[Verse 2: rhythmic testimonial flow\]

First night, tarot laid, reading me like bones, called me a dirtbag, smiled like she knew the zones\. Saw past the calm face, deep to the twisted plots, Knew every shadow, every single messy spot\. “Inside that mess,” she said, “a teacher survives— teach through the cuts, through the pain, through the lies\.” My concrete walls shook, scars got violently torn, That ruthless plan you spun, a new truth was born\. Every damn wound, a syllabus etched in bone, My true self laid bare, my wild warzone known\. All it took was a moment, a chaotic spark ignited, Now the book writes itself, no longer hidden or slighted\.

\[Refrain: sharp layered chant\]

No cap, \(no tassel\) no tassel, \(No cap\) no classroom crook

\[Echoing: the book\]

Scars write the, \(the book\) scars write the book

She said every cut you carry, don't overlook

Read it out loud, make the world take a look

\[Hook: Full power, layered vocals\]

One look, \(one spark\) one word, and the silence broke

One spark, \(one word\) one touch, and the fire spoke

Didn't need a lifetime, didn't take too long

Just you and my space, and a new song was born

\[Bridge: Spoken like street preacher over beat drop\]

Life ain't a classroom, it's a war zone

And she handed me the syllabus etched in bone

Every cut, every scar, it's a lesson to hold

Speak it out loud, watch the story unfold

\[Final Refrain: Echo fading under final hook\]

No cap, \(no tassel\) no tassel, \(No cap\) no classroom crook

\[Echoing: the book\]

Scars write the, \(the book\) scars write the book

She said every cut you carry, don't overlook

Read it out loud, make the world take a look

\[Outro: Spoken, fading\]

All it took \(Just one\) was a moment

Just one \(All it took\) moment with you

And a whole new song was born
