RyanrealAF’s “Beautifully Broken”

\[Intro: Spoken, over dusty strings and distant sirens\]

They called him Halo, but there was nothin’ saintly ‘bout his path\.

Born where prayers go unheard and hope’s just another hustle\.

He ain’t fall from grace—he crawled from fire,

Draggin’ broken dreams like chains through the mire\.

\-\-\-

\[Refrain: Bold, defiant tone\]

Don’t fix me—I’m built like this,

A puzzle of pain, a chaos kiss\.

I glow through the damage, fuck the fears

Beautifully broken despite all the tears\.

\-\-\-

\[Verse 1: Cinematic, soulful grit\]

Concrete cradle, raised by the grind,

Every scar a scripture, every loss redesigned\.

Mama gone ghost, pops was a shadow,

Learned to hustle peace from pain in the back alleys of sorrow\.

He ain't polished—he’s battleworn gold,

With a heart that limps and a story untold\.

But when life bent him, it ain’t break him—it tuned him,

Like a weapon forged in grief, where the silence consumes him\.

\-\-\-

\[Pre\-Chorus: Melodic, echoed soul\]

"Don’t fix the cracks," he said, "they let the light through\."

Each fracture’s a passage, every bruise is a clue\.

He don’t wear masks—he wear the truth loud,

A king in exile, with his chin still proud\.

\-\-\-

\[Hook: Anthemic, gospel energy\]

We the ones they tossed, now we rise from the ash,

Beautifully broken, with a soul built to clash\.

Don’t need your kingdom—we kings of the street,

Crowned in chaos, with fire at our feet\.

\-\-\-

\[Verse 2: Mid\-tempo, hypnotic rhythm\]

He met Luna in the shelter, eyes like midnight glass,

Said her dreams got stolen, but she’s takin’ ‘em back\.

Two ghosts with heartbeat—drifters, not lost,

Linked by the scars and the price of the cost\.

They ain’t kiss for comfort, they kissed for survival,

A ritual of ruin, not some fairytale revival\.

Together they climbed out the void hand in hand,

Two souls stitched in silence, tryin’ to understand\.

\-\-\-

\[Refrain: Bold, defiant tone\]

Don’t fix me—I’m built like this,

A puzzle of pain, a chaos kiss\.

I glow through the damage, fuck the fears

Beautifully broken despite all the tears\.

\-\-\-

\[Pre\-Chorus: Melodic, soft build\]

“No shame in shatterin’,” she whispered like rain,

“Some of us break to escape the chain\.”

They ain’t need to be whole, just aligned in the fight,

Fuel for each other in the heart of the night\.

\-\-\-

\[Hook: Anthemic, gospel energy\]

We the ones they tossed, now we rise from the ash,

Beautifully broken, with a soul built to clash\.

Don’t need your kingdom—we kings of the street,

Crowned in chaos, with fire at our feet\.

\-\-\-

\[Bridge: Spoken\-word, slow and weighty\]

The world labeled ‘em shattered, leftovers, freaks—

But they danced in the wreckage, kissed on cracked concrete\.

Beauty ain’t in perfection, it’s born in the mess,

In the raw, the flawed, the ones under stress\.

\-\-\-

\[Refrain: Bold, defiant tone\]

Don’t fix me—I’m built like this,

A puzzle of pain, a chaos kiss\.

I glow through the damage, fuck the fears

Beautifully broken despite all the tears\.

\-\-\-

\[Outro: Whispered chant, fading echoes\]

He ain’t fall—he rose through ruin\.

She ain’t run—she raged into truth\.

Together?

They redefined what it means to be bulletproof\.

Not clean\. Not pure\. But real\.

Beautifully\.

Broken\.
