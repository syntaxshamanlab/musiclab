GUERRILLA\.\.\.

\[echoes and glitches:\]

GUERRILLA\.\.\. Mmmarketing\.\.\.

GUERRILLA \(Guerrilla\) MARKETING\.

\[Verse 1: Deep 808s, fierce and steady flow\]

I ain’t panhandling—I’m positioning\.

Product: Me\. The message is a paradox\.

My delivery system? No tinted Benz, no boardwalk\.

Just the damp concrete under the overpass,

Preaching "Blue Lives Matter" to a congregation of junkies\.

My voice, a frequency too raw to get washed down the storm drain\.

I’m not the “shadow” your headlights glaze over\.

I’m the creative director of the American gutter—

My campaign ain't for the suburbs\.

It’s for the forgotten, the twitching, the ones who see God in a flickering lighter\.

My office? This patch of pissstained earth\.

Best damn focus group you could ever fear\.

\[Hook: Intense beat, layered chant\]

This ain't begging, it's a rebrand from the rubble\!

GUERRILLA MARKETING FOR THE SOUL\!

You see a man in the filth? I see a startup in survival mode\.

\[Verse 2: Glitching beat, aggressive tone\]

You see this cardboard? It ain’t trash\.

It’s a billboard pulled from the mouth of the void\.

You see this face? Not desperation\.

It's brand identity dipped in grime and moonlight\.

I lean in, clean with it: “I don’t need cash, just a witness\.”

And get the same static back: “Sorry, I don’t carry cash\.”

\[Beat cuts for a halfsecond of dramatic silence\]

Like I didn't just flip the damn script\.

Like I ain’t got Venmo, PayPal, Cash App, Zelle\.

My operation is more digital than your curated reality\.

But they don’t hear me—they hear a threat\.

Tuned into that old “lessthanhuman” frequency\.

I’m a mirror in the gutter, and most ain’t ready for what crawls back\.

\[Bridge: Soft beat, intense reflection\]

Every “no” is just data for the pivot\.

Every nod? Market validation\.

Every soul who stops to actually see the sermon?

That ain't charity\.

That’s brand loyalty, built between concrete pillars and pain\.

This fire in my gut? That’s not hunger\.

It’s faith\.

\[Hook: Intense beat, layered chant\]

This ain't begging, it's a rebrand from the rubble\!

\[Outro: Slow ambient beat, distorted echo chant\]

My truth hits too raw?

Like a sermon from the gutter that makes no sense?

Good\.

I’m not here to make you comfortable\.

I’m here to wake you the f up\.
