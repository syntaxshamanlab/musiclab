# The Paradoxical Woman of Woe \(The Gospel of Grey\)

__Music Direction:__ Soulful, atmospheric neo\-soul with a heavy bassline and ethereal synth pads\.

\[Intro: Melodic humming with a slight reverb | ad\-libs: "Yeah\.\.\. it's never just black and white, is it? Welcome to the grey\."\] She walks in shadows but she’s chasing the light\. A walking contradiction in the middle of the night\.

\[Verse 1: Smooth, rhythmic cadence | ad\-libs: "Say it again," "The duality\.\.\."\] The saint in her eyes, the sinner in her grin\. Where does the virtue end and the vice begin? She’s the peace in the riot, the scream in the hush\. A masterpiece painted with a charcoal brush\.

\[Pre\-Hook: Bass drops out, high\-frequency bells enter | ad\-libs: "Wait for it"\] She’ll heal your heart then leave it to rust\. Diamonds in her pocket, but her soul is made of dust\.

\[Hook: Gospel\-inspired layered harmonies | ad\-libs: "Amen to the mess," "Hallelujah"\] Oh, the Gospel of Grey, where the lines start to fade\. She’s the sun in the storm and the ice in the shade\. The paradoxical woman, she’s losing the game, But you’ll never forget how she whispered your name\.

\[Outro: Spoken over a fading drum loop, tone: contemplative\] Maybe we’re all just a little bit of both\. \[Sound cue: Record scratch, silence\]
