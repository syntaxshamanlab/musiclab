"I Said Good Day, Sir\!"

\[Dark, haunting, cinematic beat—slow and fierce\. Vocals dominating the rhythm\.\]

The devil walks past, and I nod—like a friend,

Some nights you survive, some—you pray for the end\.”

\[Intro: Spoken, eerie, with a slight pitch shift or echo for extra presence\]

You don’t impress me, boy, not in the least,

I’ve seen monsters that’d turn you to meat\.

And yet, I’ve seen those same hands give their last,

To a kid with no coat, in a world built to crash\.

\[Hook: Spoken, eerie, like a ghost whispering through the track\]

"The devil walks past, and I nod—like a friend,

Some nights you survive, some—you pray for the end\."

\[Beat breathes, deep 808s rumbling\]

\[Verse 1: Calm but cold, like a man who's seen too much to be fazed\]

They told me, “Don’t go there,” said I wouldn’t last,

Like I ain’t spent nights where the devil walks past\.

Like I ain’t heard whispers that cut through the dark,

Or seen mercy and murder play hands in the park\.

I been where the air tastes heavy with sin,

Where angels got ink and their halos wear thin\.

Where wolves keep their heads on a swivel to live,

And a handshake can turn to a blade in the ribs\.

\[Bridge: Beat slows, eerie melody floats in, words hit like a gut punch\]

You think I flinch ‘cause your jaw’s locked tight?

Boy, I done slept through the edge of a knife\.

Prison taught me not to beg, not to run,

But to nod at the reaper and wait for the sun\.

\[Low murmur or ad\-lib after "sun" to deepen the feeling\.\]

\[Hook: Comes back like a warning, slightly more intense\]

"The devil walks past, and I nod—like a friend,

Some nights you survive, some—you pray for the end\."

The devil walks past, and I nod—like a friend,

Some nights you survive, some—you pray for the end\.

\[Beat pulses, breathes—pausing before dropping back in hard\]

\[Verse 2: A little more weight in the voice, like a man getting tired of explaining himself\]

See, I don’t walk mean, I don’t flex, I don’t shout,

I just stand like I’ve seen what you dream about\.

Ain’t gotta act tough, ain’t gotta pretend,

‘Cause I know who I am, I don’t break, I don’t bend\.

Some frat boy mean mugs, tryna act real hard,

Like he ever seen death in a prison yard\.

Like he ever felt fate breathing down his neck,

Or heard his own name in a whispered death check\.

\[Bridge: Slower, weightier, like gravel in the throat\]

You don’t impress me, boy, not in the least,

I’ve seen monsters that’d turn you to meat\.

And yet, I’ve seen those same hands give their last,

To a kid with no coat, in a world built to crash\.

\[Gravelly delivery on "crash"—let it linger\.\]

\[Hook: Final time, delivered with slow, deliberate power—like a closing statement\]

"The devil walks past, and I nod—like a friend,

Some nights you survive, some—you pray for the end\."

\[Outro: Beat fades, like footsteps disappearing into the night—soft wind, distant sirens\]
