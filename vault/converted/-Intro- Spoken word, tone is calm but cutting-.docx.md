\[TED talk/Trap\]

What do call a group of cackling hens, if they're not hens?

What if they're roosters\!

\[Intro: Spoken word, tone is calm but cutting, soft beat\]

They say real ones don’t need to explain, but sometimes you gotta set the table before you serve the plate\.

See, where I come from, men handle biz—they don’t chirp like pigeons in a park lookin’ for crumbs\.

Gossip? That’s featherweight energy, straight poultry vibes\.

If you cluckin’ from the sidelines, best believe—I’m still winnin’ the block

\[Hook: Bouncy, off\-beat hits\]

You squawk—I slide—

You talk—I glide—

You cluck—I rise—

Fall back—too fried\.

I hear that talk, can’t trust that vibe,

Feathers get fluffed when I step outside\.

I walk through flames, never just squawk,

I get real done—you just talk\.

\[Hook: Bouncy, off\-beat hits\]

You squawk—I slide—

You talk—I glide—

You cluck—I rise—

Fall back—too fried\.

I hear that talk, can’t trust that vibe,

Feathers get fluffed when I step outside\.

I walk through flames, never just squawk,

I get real done—you just talk\.

\[Verse 1: Cold and direct\]

Y’all stay flappin’ like fans in July,

I breeze past gossip—don’t blink, just fly\.

You watching my moves? That’s cute, that’s rich,

But wifey and I say get off my\.\.\. switch\.

Do her a favor, do me one too—

Get off my name, get back to your boo\.

I'm so unimpressed, get outta my face,

I’m chasin’ my bag, not keepin' your pace\.

\[Pre\-Hook: Aggressive emphasis\]

To you? I’m famous—funny twist,

Don’t know your name, but you clench your fists\.

Keep my name in your mouth like a pacifier,

Meanwhile I’m torchin’, full\-blown fire\.

\[Hook: Bouncy, off\-beat hits\]

You squawk—I slide—

You talk—I glide—

You cluck—I rise—

Fall back—too fried\.

I hear that talk, can’t trust that vibe,

Feathers get fluffed when I step outside\.

I walk through flames, never just squawk,

I get real done—you just talk\.

\[Verse 2: Sharp and unbothered\]

I ain’t in the room, but I’m center stage,

Got ‘em rattled like birds in a wire cage\.

I’m a bum? Then what’s that make you?

Focused on me while your own life’s through?

They scroll my name like it’s pay\-per\-view,

Still broke, still bitter—what’s new?

Call me a joke? Then laugh out loud,

But why you so mad when I’m not even proud?

\[Bridge: Spoken, cocky delivery\]

I’m Ryan Real A\-F, bruh, I don’t pretend\.

I build in silence, while y’all play pretend\.

If cluckin’s your brand—go head, do you,

But don't act surprised when I level right through\.

\[Outro: Spoken word, public service announcement\]

Look, if talkin’ about me fills some void in your life—

That’s between you, your conscience, and your therapist\.

I ain’t even mad\.

But do wifey and I both a favor—

Get on her more\.\.\. and me less\.

I’m a bum\.

I'm—A—Fucking Bum\!

a broke content creator\.

I’m the voice of the voiceless\.

And I still got more peace than you\.

Stay cluckin’\.

I’ll stay movin’\.
