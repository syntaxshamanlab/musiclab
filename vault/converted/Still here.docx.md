Tracks of Fire & Flesh: The Story of Skittlez, Told by RyanrealAF

\[Spoken Word Intro –steady cadence, reflective but fierce tone, over low hum of train wheels & sub\-bass\]

This ain’t just a story—it’s a reckoning\. A chronicle of what happens when love survives where the system fails, when fire builds homes the world keeps tearing down\. Skittlez didn’t fall through the cracks—she lived in ‘em\. Slept between society’s blind spots with a raccoon for a witness and a man they called broken, but who carried her through storms\. This piece ain’t here for sympathy\. It’s here for remembrance\. For resurrection\. For every voice that got hushed behind case files and compliance checklists\. You’re about to hear truth carved from gravel, stitched in struggle, baptized in betrayal—and still, she rises\. Still, she’s here\.

\[Beat: Industrial echo, low synths, train FX—slow build\]

\[Verse 1: Steady delivery, thunderous beat underneath\]

Skittlez—raccoon on her shoulder, hell in her lungs,

Not homeless—she holy, where the wild things run\.

Black—half devil, half savior, heart bruised but lit,

Society tossed him, but she saw the grit\.

I’m the griot—RyanrealAF, myth\-stitchin' the pain,

Turnin’ back\-alley blues into lyrical flame\.

\[Hook: She Still Here | Chant\-Like Echo\]

They broke her home\. \(Still here\.\)

Burned what she built\. \(Still here\.\)

Cut off her love\. \(Still here\.\)

Tried to erase her—she reappeared\. \(Still\. Here\.\)

They changed the locks\. \(Still here\.\)

Flipped the script\. \(Still here\.\)

Called her a risk\. \(Still here\.\)

She carved her name in ash and grit\. \(Still\. Here\.\)

\[Verse 2: Mid\-tempo grit, defiant tone\]

Santa Barbara lookin’ like Eden in disguise,

But its fruit is bitter—truth in palm tree lies\.

She learned to vanish, sleep with one eye open,

Buildin’ homes from hurt and hope unspoken\.

Every plank was protest\. Every tarp a prayer\.

System said “progress,” then bulldozed her care\.

\[Bridge: Spoken, slower, with minimalist keys\]

They offered help laced with rules and chains\.

Said love like hers was too wild for frames\.

“Leave him,” they said, “He holds you back\.”

But they never saw the fire in the cracks\.

She bent their rules just to keep him near\.

Lived in silence\. But she was always clear\.

\[Verse 3: Aggressive, gritty flow\]

Case manager smirks\. Outreach talks in circles\.

Promise you heaven—leave you in hurdles\.

She stood up, asked why\. Doors slammed fast\.

They don’t like rebels who remember their past\.

Kicked her out like trash in the dead of night\.

But she walked tall—no tears, just fight\.

\[Hook: She Still Here | Reprise with Echo FX\]

They broke her home\. \(Still here\.\)

Burned what she built\. \(Still here\.\)

Cut off her love\. \(Still here\.\)

Tried to erase her—she reappeared\. \(Still\. Here\.\)

They changed the locks\. \(Still here\.\)

Flipped the script\. \(Still here\.\)

Called her a risk\. \(Still here\.\)

She carved her name in ash and grit\. \(Still\. Here\.\)

\[Final Verse: Slow burn, poetic cadence\]

Stars above didn’t care—but they watched\.

Concrete bed, soul half\-caught\.

She kept goin’—not for hope, but defiance\.

Not for faith, but the silence in riots\.

You ask why she stays? ‘Cause the myth ain’t done\.

She’s the flame\. I’m the flint\. Together—we run\.

\[Outro: Spoken over fading train FX and piano notes\]

They tore her down\.

They called it progress\.

But she’s still burnin’\.

Still echoing through the tracks\.

And now\.\.\. she got a mic\.
