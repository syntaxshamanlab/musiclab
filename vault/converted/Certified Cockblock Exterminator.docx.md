# Certified Cockblock Exterminator

__Music Direction:__ Upbeat, funky G\-Funk with a signature high\-pitched synth lead and groovy bass\.

\[Intro: Party background noise, laughter | ad\-libs: "Excuse me, I believe you’re standing in the way of progress\. Move\."\] The vibe was 100 till you walked in the room\. Now the energy is lower than a tomb\.

\[Verse 1: Playful, rhythmic bounce | ad\-libs: "Clear the path," "Certified\!"\] I see the tactical maneuver, the 'accidental' spill\. You’re trying to kill the spirit, trying to kill the thrill\. But I got the credentials, I got the license too\. To remove the obstacle\.\.\. and baby, that’s you\.

\[Pre\-Hook: Synth lead gets louder | ad\-libs: "Pest control\!"\] I’m a professional, I work with precision\. Clearing the static so we got the vision\.

\[Hook: Funky, rhythmic chant | ad\-libs: "Clear 'em out\!", "Move\!"\] Certified exterminator, cleaning up the block\. You can’t stop the timing, you can’t stop the clock\. Exterminator, making room for the heat\. If you’re just a hurdle, get off of the street\.

\[Outro: Spoken, tone: sarcastic and smooth\] I’ll send you the invoice for the relocation\. You’re welcome\. \[Sound cue: Funky bass lick, sliding finish\]
