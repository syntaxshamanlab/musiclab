__\(You're on my team\)__

__And why__

__—__

__Alright let's begin\!__

\[Intro: TED\-style, deliberate, pulsing bass under commanding voice\]  
 They spin my songs—Ms\. Ghost, Present Today—  
 and they judge me quick,  
 sayin’, 

\[whining voice\] “One lie and you cut people off? That’s how you play?”

  
 Then they preach back at me,

\[whining voice\]  “But what about grace?”  
 See, they don’t get it\.

  
 I ain’t killing grace—I’m protecting my space\.  
 Grace ain’t gone, but grace don’t mean gullible\.  
 Grace forgives weakness, but grace don’t trust masks\.

\[Build: Minimalist, sharp cadence, intellectual rhythm\]  
 You can lie to the planet, scam the crowd, sell the show,  
 wear a hundred faces, play magician, play ghost\.  
 But when you face me? Don’t front, don’t pose\.  
 A counterfeit soul is the first thing exposed\.  
 Look in my eyes, and I better see truth,  
 not a staged performance, not a rehearsed proof\.  
 Fakeness is poison, it eats through the bone,  
 and a bond without trust is a fortress of stone\.

\[Hook: Resonant chant, TED\-style vocal authority\]  
 If you’re on my team—  
 you on my team\.  
 Same lane, same aim,  
 same fire, same dream\.

\[Refrain: Call\-and\-response, staccato, echoing thought\]  
 If you’re not on my team—  
 \(you’re not on my team\)\.

\[Verse 1: Punchy, explanatory, teaching cadence\]  
 I don’t trip if you slip, if you stumble, collapse,  
 if you fumble the pass, if you crash in the clash\.  
 That’s one game lost, not the season destroyed—  
 your honest voice keeps the trust employed\.  
 If you confess your mistake, I can hold that ground,  
 'cause honesty builds bridges where betrayal drowns\.  
 Weakness I can handle, confession I respect,  
 but deception's the cancer that corrodes the connect\.

\[Refrain: Louder, audience echo, persuasive emphasis\]  
 If you’re not on my team—  
 \(you’re not on my team\)\.

\[Verse 2: Aggressive TED delivery, vivid imagery\]  
 But if you're schemin' like a serpent, hidin' in the night,  
 whispering in shadows while avoiding the light—  
 then you’re not beside me, you’re behind me with a knife\.  
 And that ain’t a teammate, that’s a parasite for life\.  
 See, I want wolves at my table, warriors at my side,  
 not hyenas in the grass waiting for my pride to die\.  
 I want soldiers who stumble but confess their sin,  
 not ghosts in the smoke with betrayal on the wind\.  
 My circle ain’t casual, it’s a covenant creed\.  
 This ain’t friendship for clout, it's a battlefield need\.  
 And betrayal from within cuts sharper than a spear,  
 'cause the enemy outside ain't the one I fear\.

\[Hook: Commanding, audience\-engaged, elevated energy\]  
 If you ain’t on my team—  
 you don’t sit in my circle\.  
 You don’t stand in my trust\.  
 You don’t breathe in my fire\.  
 Your word turns dust\.

\[Refrain: War drum pulse, pounding, emphatic echo\]  
 If you’re not on my team—  
 \(you’re not on my team\)\.

\[Outro: Spoken, deliberate, slow cadence, final proof\]  
 Loyalty ain’t halos, it ain’t spotless dreams\.  
 It’s scars admitted, it’s blood in the seams\.  
 It’s showing me the truth, no matter how heavy or raw,  
 not hiding your sins from the unforgiving law\.  
 One code\. One crew\.  
 One season\. One truth\.  
 One fire\. One proof\.  
 One unshaken team\.

\[Final Refrain: Whisper to commanding shout, TED\-style closure\]  
 If you’re not on my team—  
 \(you’re not on my team\)\.
