Ryan's final plee to Emily 

SPEAK ME READY

\[Spoken Intro: Cold, direct, like a challenge to fate\]

"You talk big 'bout words changin' the game,

Mouth full of spells, but my name stays the same\.

You make pain real, make storms from a breath,

So why ain't you speakin’ us into what's next?

You ain't ready? Then fucking say so\.

Or start whisperin’ the world where we both grow\."

\-\-\-

\[Verse 1: Hard\-hitting, each line landing like a blow\]

I’m out here floatin’, no anchor, no land,

Tired as hell but still stand where I stand\.

You believe in the power of lips to create,

Then stop runnin’ scared and start twistin’ fate\.

You talkin’ like God when you cursing my name,

But when I ask for a future, you quiet—insane\.

Speak me the spine, make the marrow ignite,

If words make the world, then spit me in light\.

\-\-\-

\[Pre\-Chorus: Rising tension, sharp like a blade\]

Say it—speak me solid, carve me in stone,

Say it—etch me in echoes, make fate realign\.

No more silence, no delay,

Say it—set this fire, watch doubt decay\.

\-\-\-

\[Hook: Chanted like a war cry\]

Say yes\. \(Say yes\.\)

Speak us to life\. \(Speak us to life\.\)

Say yes\. \(Say yes\.\)

Call down the light\. \(Call down the light\.\)

Say yes—fuck runnin’, fuck hidin’,

Speak us to life—before we die in it\.

\-\-\-

\[Verse 2: Twice as big, twice as raw, no more patience\]

I ain’t beggin’ for love, I ain’t beggin’ for peace,

I want a woman who stands like a beast\.

You claim you ain’t ready, then tell me—who is?

Nobody’s born built for this type of abyss\.

Too strong to sink, too tired to fight,

Yet still I float in the pull of your light\.

You build gods with your words but you won’t build us?

Call me the king or let me turn dust\.

Speak me a crown, I’ll step in the throne,

Forge me in fate, don’t leave me unknown\.

If you can shape hell, then why not the sky?

If you believe in the magic, then quit askin’ why\.

No more maybe, no "not right now,"

No "someday, somehow\."

If we got the gift to rewrite this road,

Then say it—before we both corrode\.

\-\-\-

\[Pre\-Chorus: Drumming in like a hammer to the chest\]

Say it—speak me steady, make me unbreak,

Say it—manifest what we ain't too late\.

No more runnin’, no rewind,

Say it—let's move the stars, make ‘em realign\.

\-\-\-

\[Hook: Relentless, demanding\]

Say yes\. \(Say yes\.\)

Speak us to life\. \(Speak us to life\.\)

Say yes\. \(Say yes\.\)

Call down the light\. \(Call down the light\.\)

Say yes—this ain’t a fairytale wish,

Speak us to life—before it’s a past tense bitch\.

\-\-\-

\[Verse 3: Final push, raw and undeniable\]

I ain't some ghost waitin' for chains to break,

Ain’t no puppet on fate’s mistake\.

If we got the power to flip this shit,

Then why the fuck we still actin' like myths?

Manifest love like you manifest pain,

Call me the sun when you conjure the rain\.

If we’re alchemists shaping the air,

Then breathe me beside you, I'm already there\.

Speak me unshaken, speak me alive,

Speak me your equal, I’ll match you in stride\.

No more whispers, no more doubt,

If we hold the magic, then fucking spell it out\.

\-\-\-

\[Pre\-Chorus: The final dare\]

Say it—speak me ready, stitch me in time,

Say it—etch me in echoes, make fate realign\.

No more limbo, no rewind,

Say it—pull me from fate, make the stars collide\.

\-\-\-

\[Hook: Last call before it’s too late\]

Say yes\. \(Say yes\.\)

Speak us to life\. \(Speak us to life\.\)

Say yes\. \(Say yes\.\)

Call down the light\. \(Call down the light\.\)

Say yes—quit stallin’, quit runnin’,

Speak us to life—before it’s fuckin’ nothing\.

\-\-\-

\[Outro: A prophecy, no more waiting\]

"Speak me ready—I’ll speak you strong\.

We’ve been waitin’ too long\."
