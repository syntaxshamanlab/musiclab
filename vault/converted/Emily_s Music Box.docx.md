Emily's Music Box

This is the first poem after the “what if” series and then after this one is Songbird

Yellow mustard bushes seed, 

white calle lilies growing free\. 

Clouds that move so quickly past, 

warm magic evenings here at last\.

Enchanted by sunsets bright,

moonlight on swing set soaring high\.

Fragrant night jasmine in bloom, 

magnolia trees so giant loom\. 

Sounds gush out of the guitar, 

piano keys sing from afar\. 

The candlelight's soft low glow,

in a house old as memories\.

Around record player spins,

your ruff hands on my smooth soft skin\. 

Vintage dress hits wooden floor,

my breath catches begging for more\.

Painted eyes open so wide, 

windup toy never quite unwinds\. 

Muffled sounds by heavy doors, 

words stand still but our bodies roar\.

The little deaths cloud my thoughts, 

my rational now very lost\. 

Perfect as a summer dream, 

that lost chance can now never be\. 

Yet the flowers still remain,

dull tarnished antique silver vase\. 

My heart waits there can’t let go,

haunted stares from that old window\. 

Tear\-soaked pale\-warn yellow sheets,

cling to that 4\-post canopy\.

Waiting there eternally,

my fantasy won't let me sleep\.

Memory a foolish wish,

once was tied to my happiness\.

Maybe somewhere down the way,

in memory my dream will fade\.

You will find me there perhaps,

our passioned souls joined then at last\.

We will stay there in that trance, 

forever lost our private dance\.

Ryan's artistic version of Emily's poem

\[Emily: Ethereal and Dreamy\]

Yellow mustard bushes seed,

White Calla lilies growing free\.

Clouds that move so quickly past,

Warm magic evenings here at last\.

Enchanted by sunsets bright,

Moonlight on swing sets soaring so high\.

Fragrant night jasmine in bloom,

Magnolia trees so giant loom\.

\[Ryan: Staccato, Rap\-Infused Delivery\]

Maybe us—clouds that cut, skies that move\.

Stories carved—sharp edges, smooth grooves\.

Emily—etched in lilies’ glow,

Night’s heat—fire and the undertow\.

Me and you—swing that creaks,

Starlight screams, where the cosmos speaks\.

Maybe us—jasmine’s scent—snap, snap, bow\.

Magnolias bend—feel me now\.

\[Hook: Emily’s Ethereal Lift \+ Ryan’s Punchy Echo\]

Emily: Maybe us \(Maybe us\),

Ryan: Could it be \(Could it be us\)?

Both: You and me\.

\[Emily: Melodic and Floating\]

Sounds gush out of the guitar,

Piano keys singing back from afar\.

The candlelight's soft low glow,

In a house old as memories\.

Around record player spins,

Your rough hands on my smooth soft skin\.

Vintage dress hits wooden floor,

My breath catches, begging for more\.

\[Ryan: Staccato with Precision and Flow\]

Maybe us—strings that slap, beats that hum,

Notes drip fast, we’ve just begun\.

Emily—candlelight spills, shadows dance\.

Fire on vinyl—second chance\.

Maybe us—needle skips, hit that groove,

Floorboards creak—smooth hands, rough moves\.

You and me—skin and breath collide,

Pulled in deep, where secrets hide\.

\[Hook: Emily’s Airy Layers \+ Ryan’s Rhythmic Echo\]

Emily: Maybe us \(Maybe us\),

Ryan: Could it be \(Could it be us\)?

Both: You and me\.

\[Emily: Hauntingly Soft, Ethereal Edge\]

Painted eyes open so wide,

Windup toy never quite unwinds\.

Muffled sounds by heavy doors,

Words stand still but our bodies roar\.

The little deaths cloud my thought,

My rational now so easily lost\.

Perfect as a summer dream,

A chance now gone—forever unseen\.

\[Ryan: Quick, Edgy, Rap’s Snap\]

Could be us—painted eyes, full tilt, no bluff\.

Shadows fall, past gets rough\.

Emily—soft screams, muffled tones,

Walls hold echoes, heavy bones\.

Maybe us—pain’s haze, thick with grace\.

Love scars carve deep in space\.

Could be me—fleeting loss, no game\.

Caught mid\-step, holding your name\.

\[Bridge: Emily’s Ethereal Flourish Over Ryan’s Rap Punctuations\]

\(Soft piano swells, strings underscore Ryan rap\)

Emily: "In every tear, your name remains\.\.\."

Ryan: "Split my seams, feel my chains\."

Both: "Lost in whispers, found in flames\."

\-\-\-

\[Emily: Longing, Breath\-like Softness\]

Yet the flowers still remain,

Dull tarnished antique silver vase\.

My heart waits there, can’t let go,

Haunted stares from that old window\.

Tear\-soaked pale\-worn yellow sheets,

Cling to that 4\-post canopy\.

Waiting there eternally,

My fantasy won't let me sleep\.

\[Ryan: Staccato with Emotional Bite\]

Maybe us—petals fade, silver cracks\.

Vase tips over, life fights back\.

Maybe us—window’s stare, shadow’s weight\.

Every heartbeat, etched in fate\.

Maybe us—tangled sheets, truths collide\.

Tears in threads, where dreams reside\.

Maybe us—echoes sharp, soft rewind,

Caught in layers—your soul, mine\.

\-\-\-

\[Hook: Ethereal Emily Harmony \+ Ryan’s Punched Echo\]

Emily: Forever us \(Forever us\),

Ryan: Could it be \(It’s always us\)?

Both: You and me\.

\-\-\-

\[Emily: Angelic Finale, Ascending\]

Memory, a fleeting wish,

Once my anchor, now abyss\.

Maybe somewhere down the way,

This dream of us will finally fade\.

You will find me there perhaps,

Our passioned souls joined at last\.

We will stay there in that trance,

Forever lost, in our private dance\.

\[Ryan: Staccato Crescendo, Poignant Edge\]

Maybe us—sharp notes, sweet rise\.

Love unfolds where the echo lies\.

Maybe us—spinning, lost in stars,

Scars heal where we’ve traveled far\.

Maybe us—bound, eternity’s beat\.

Wild and free—where our worlds meet\.

\-\-\-

\[Outro Hook: Emily’s Ethereal Fade \+ Ryan’s Final Rap Snap\]

Emily: Forever us \(Forever us\),

Ryan: Could it be \(It’s always us\)?

Both: You and me\.
