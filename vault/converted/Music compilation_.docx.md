\[Rhythmic storytelling: vocal always dominate the rhythm with boom\-bap bounce\]

The Paradoxical Woman of Woe\!

In shades of gray, where truths don't quite align,

Lived a Woman of Paradox, a curious design\!

Not black, not white, but a swirly\-whirly blend,

On "Never" and "Always," her notions would bend\!

"For folks," she would say, with a flip of her crown,

"Are zig\-zaggy puzzles all over this town\!

No 'always' so steady, no 'never' so fast,

We're question mark walkers whose answers won't last\!"

And this Woman of Woe, oh the things she would say\!

"Be gentle, be lamb\-like\!" then "Roar like the day\!"

"Be soft as a bunny\!" then "Grit like a stone\!"

Her wants were like winds that just constantly blown\!

"Be rugged\!" she'd bellow, with a spark in her gaze,

But rough\-and\-tumble antics would send her in haze\!

"Be tender," she'd murmur, like dew on a bloom,

But hands without thunder? Just filled her with gloom\!

Step lightly? "You're nothing\!" she'd sharply declare\.

Step firmly? "A danger\! Oh, have a good scare\!"

Not enough? With a "Poof\!" she would vanish so quick\.

Too much? You'd be labeled a terrible brick\!

That balance she danced on, a thin, wobbly string,

One wrong little wiggle, and sorrow would sing\!

Then silence would settle, like dust on a shelf,

Or worse, a deep shaming that poisoned your self\!

Then the bedroom appeared, with its covers askew,

Where the ghosts of past lovers still whispered, "It's true\.\.\."

Move slow? She would sigh, like a wilting\-down weed\.

Show you cared? "Are you doubting my honor and deed?"

But press in too hard, with a passionate might,

Her history might holler throughout the long night\!

So a fellow would ponder, with knots in his brow,

"Which 'yes' is a green light, and which is a 'Not Now'?"

"You crave my affection?" she'd suddenly boom,

"Then speak with a voice that dispels all the gloom\!

You desire my power? Don't bait with a hush,

Then cry like you didn't beg, that's it woman ENOUGH\!

"Don't call me too often, with your needy 'Hello\!'

After telling me, 'Man up\! You just have to grow\!'"

For this fellow declared, with a resolute huff,

"I'm not every this\-that, I've just had enough\!

I won't play the roles that your memories keep,

I'll love you quite plainly, or quietly creep\!

No bleeding for entry, no proving my case,

In the dizzying whirl of your whimsical space\!"

So that throne where she sat, with its prickles and pranks,

He said, "Keep it, oh madam, with all of its shanks\!

I'll build my own haven, where breezes blow true,

And peace doesn't need a strange mask to see through\!"

He'd be the wild tempest that asks for no shed,

The true\-burning fire, though the wary all fled\!

Yes, this Paradox Woman, a puzzling old fright,

In the Gospel of Gray, she mixed darkness and light\!

 \[Vocals cut sharp—preacher’s grit meets streetwise swagger, raw and commanding\]

Ni Tuya, Ni Mía 

\(Sancho Sagrado\)

Ni Tuya, Ni Mía 

\(Sancho Sagrado\)

\[Intro: Spoken, slow and deadly\]

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

I ain’t her man\.

I’m the reckoning\.

She escaped—she rose\.

I handed her the shovel\.

\[Verse 1\]

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

She call me Sancho, but say it like a damn psalm\.

I’m the reason she walks different, the crack in her calm\.

You had her cryin’ in silence—

I had her screamin’ in truth\.

Too holy to chase, too raw to worship—

I played mirror with a hard dick and a deeper motive\.

You branded her needy—I called her divine\.

She ain’t mine, she ain’t yours,

She’s finally fuckin’ free\.

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

\[Hook\]

Ni tuya, ni mía—ella es un templo\.

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

No la cuido, le enseño el ejemplo\.

No me ama, se recordó\.

Yo fui la llama, y ella explotó\.

Not yours\. Not mine\. She holy as hell\.

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

She dipped from the lie and broke out the shell\.

I ain’t her future—I’m the fuckin’ flame\.

She left the leash\. Burned the name\.

\[Verse 2\]

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

I ain’t soft, I ain’t sweet,

I shout revolutions between her teeth\.

She didn’t find love—she found leverage\.

I’m here to erase the illusion

That she ever needed your half\-ass masculinity\.

I ain’t her security, I’m the alarm that woke her\.

Too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

I’m the end of excuses, the start of boundaries\.

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

\[Bridge: Whispered\]

She ain’t la otra\.

I’m el otro\.

Not to replace, just remind—

She never needed no pinche man to shine\.

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

\[Hook: Repeat with power\]

Ni tuya, ni mía—ella es un templo\.

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

No la cuido, le enseño el ejemplo\.

No me ama, se recordó\.

Yo fui la llama, y ella explotó\.

Not yours\. Not mine\. She holy as hell\.

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

She dipped from the lie and broke out the shell\.

I ain’t her future—I’m the fuckin’ flame\.

She left the leash\. Burned the name\.

\[Outro: Spoken, slow fade\]

Sancho Sagrado—too holy to chase, too raw to worship\.

Not her man, not her master—

Just the last motherfucker she needed

Before she became her own damn God\.

\[rhythm that stomps like boots on broken glass\]

<a id="_j5x43o1w7w8q"></a> "Shit You Gon’ See"

\[Intro: Narration, venom in the voice\]

Yo—this ain’t no fairy tale, this that concrete communion\.

Where halos rust and halos bust, where prayers get pistol\-whipped\.

I ain’t preachin' peace—I’m layin’ out pain with precision\.

Welcome to the jungle, bitch—where survival is religion\.

\[Verse 1: narration Relentless, jagged flow\]

In the belly of the beast where the pavement prays,

Where the devil sells hope and the angels blaze\.

There was Slick—slicker than oil on blood,

Carried street maps in scars, and walked like a flood\.

He ain’t need no Glock—his mind was the clip,

Every alley he stepped in got tight from the grip\.

From fiends whisperin' sins to blue lights that scream,

He maneuvered like chess while they movin’ like memes\.

And while cowards slept with they conscience clean,

He bled for the block, and baptized the scene\.

\[Pre\-Chorus: Haunting, reverb\-soaked narration\]

Oh, the shit you gon’ see under lights that flicker,

Every lie, every body, every pulse beatin’ quicker\.

Choices sharp as blades, chances thin as air—

You either make moves or make coffins stare\.

\[Hook: Riot chant, militant layering\]

Oh, the shit you gon’ see\! Under these crooked\-ass lights\!

Where they gamble with breath from the wrongs to the rights\!

The blood and the rise\-up, the fall and the flame—

This the rhythm of the real, not a goddamn game\!

Yeah\! This the rhythm of the real, not a goddamn game\!

\[Verse 2: narration with Snapped cadence, militant clarity\]

He peeped young wolves tryna outrun fate,

Eyes full of fire, jaws full of hate\.

Some chased dreams, some chased a fix,

All tryna break free from this rigged\-ass mix\.

He barked from the gut—"You got brain, you got bones\!

You ain’t no slave to these digital clones\!

Stand tall, take hits, spit back when they swing\!

Don’t you ever let ‘em clip your goddamn wings\!"

He ain't coach, he ain't cop, he was scripture in steel,

Told ‘em, “Pain ain't the enemy—not feelin' is real\.”

\[Bridge: Meltdown, ambient chaos, cracked sermon\]

The street ain’t fair—it’s a blade with no hilt,

A game where the scoreboard’s written in guilt\.

But if you play bold, if you break their mold—

You might just write legends before you grow old\.

So write them in blood, so write them in gold\.

\[Final Hook: War drum tempo, shouted echoes\]

Oh, the shit you gon’ see\! Under these crooked\-ass lights\!

From sun\-up to set\-traps, through them ruthless\-ass nights\!

The hunger, the hustle, the holy in pain—

This the rhythm of the streets, not no chart\-top chain\!

Yeah\! This the rhythm of the streets, not no chart\-top chain\!

\[Outro: Echoed growl, poetic threat\]

So hear this, young blood—every line got teeth\.

Truth don’t come gentle—it comes with grief\.

When the world throws chains, you craft keys in rhyme\.

This ain’t no bedtime story, it’s Psalms for grime\.

\[Echo fades: “Psalms for grime… Scars in time…”\]

She certified 

\[spoken word intro: narration\]

She don’t do it for clout\. Ain’t no cameras flashin’, no stories spinnin’\. She do it ‘cause out here, loyalty don’t come gift\-wrapped—it come bruised, broke, and barely breathin’\. One woman holdin’ it down for a whole squad of ghosts who either locked up, strung out, or just too scared to stand\. Ain’t no fairytales in this grind—just favors traded like currency, bodies used like band\-aids, and silence treated like scripture\. But her? She take the weight, no complaints, no scoreboard—just one more night, one more hustle, one more “I got you” when no one else will\.

\[Verse 1\]

Out here—sex got price tags, razors, traps

It ain’t love—it’s lures, it’s setups, it's maps

I seen girls flirt just to stay warm

Sellin’ a piece just to weather the storm

Then she came through—no flex, no fee

Did it for nothin’ but dignity

No shame, no angles, no game

Just made sure I left with my name

\[Chorus\]

Certified Cockblock Exterminator

Turned what they weaponized into favor

She ain't trickin'—she defendin’ the real

Gave me cover, not bait for a deal

Certified Cockblock Exterminator

Fought fire with fire—soul navigator

She ain’t owe me—but still took the hit

Used what they fear just to keep me legit

\[Verse 2\]

I seen setups—smiles that lead to the van

Seen homies stripped for flirtin’ with the wrong hand

Girls doin’ dirt just to find a lil’ peace

Then cryin' behind dumpsters, prayin' for release

But she—nah, she ain’t play that route

She stepped in, pulled me out

Ain’t my girl, ain’t my blood, no chain

But I owe her my bones, my name, my brain

\[Chorus\]

Certified Cockblock Exterminator

Blocked them setups and fake narrators

Held space in a world that burns

Gave me grace, never asked returns

Certified Cockblock Exterminator

Moved like smoke, heart like a crater

She ain't safe—but she kept me whole

Ain’t no song can measure that role

\[Bridge – Spoken, beat stripped back\]

She ain’t no lead in a movie scene

Ain’t no flowers, no flash, no dream

She took shame and flipped it to shield

Made herself the weapon they couldn’t wield

She took one for the team—again

Not ‘cause she had to

But 'cause no one else did

And if you know?

You know\.

\[Final Chorus – Dragged tempo, build pressure\]

Certified Cockblock Exterminator

Unpaid, unpraised, but always greater

She ain’t ask for a word or song

But her name’s why I made it this long

Certified Cockblock Exterminator

Lone wolf, soul ventilator

Out here, love’s a debt we regret

But her grace? I won’t forget

\[Spoken word Outro\]

She’s the one who talked the predator down

Who walked me away when the setup was live

Who gave herself, piece by piece

So I could keep mine intact

Not a queen in a crown

But a saint in the struggle

She’s why I’m still breathin’\.

\[HOOK – HYPED, CONFIDENT DELIVERY\] 

\[Beat drops – heavy 808s, wide stereo spread\] 

Two fat bitches and I’m hittin’ it,

Two fat bitches and I’m hittin’ it,

Two fat bitches and I’m hittin’ it,

Two fat bitches and I’m hittin’ it,

Same damn time, same damn time, same damn time, same damn time,

They talk loud but I’m catchin’ it,

Both wanna ride with a real one,

Big curves, whole vibe so clean,

Woke up to thick and the dream\.

\[VERSE 1 – LAID BACK BUT LUSTFUL, SMOOTH CADENCE\] 

\[Beat strips to kick\-snare\-bass groove\] 

Big hips got me twisted, can’t quit it,

Body so real, got me lost in it,

Confidence loud, but the vibe stay chill,

Both in the trap, my type of sex appeal\.

Soft skin, heavy stare, no cap,

Talk back quick, but they arch like that,

Style too clean, got the whole room watchin’,

Same damn time, and they both ain’t stoppin’\.

\[VERSE 2 – MORE AGGRESSIVE, LOCKED IN FLOW\] 

\[Snare doubles, low\-end rumbles harder\] 

Two hands full but who’s keeping score,

They don’t compete, ‘cause I’m still wanting more,

One on my neck, one grindin’ slow,

Switchin’ positions but they move like pros\.

Mind so sharp, got my head on tilt,

Thick with a vibe, and the tension built,

I don’t chase, just let ‘em set pace,

Still in control with a grin on my face\.

\[VERSE 3 – CLIMAX, DOMINANT DELIVERY, BASS STRETCHED OUT\] 

\[Hi\-hats roll, beat opens wide for vocal power\] 

Ain’t no shame in the way I live,

Two of them thick, and they both give

What the world can’t fake, what the small can't feel,

Everything soft, but the grip stay real\.

One with the lips that don’t let go,

Other got thighs like a tempo slow,

Both hold weight, but they carry it sweet,

Two thrones, one king, and we all gon’ eat\.

\[HOOK \(REPRISE\) – EVEN MORE ENERGY, CROWD CHANT STYLE\] 

\[Chants layered behind lead vocals, beat hits hard\] Two fat bitches and I’m hittin’ it,

Two fat bitches and I’m hittin’ it,

Two fat bitches and I’m hittin’ it,

Two fat bitches and I’m hittin’ it,

Same damn time, same damn time, same damn time, same damn time,

They talk loud but I’m catchin’ it,

Both wanna ride with a real one,

Big curves, whole vibe so clean,

Woke up to thick and the dream\.

\[SPOKEN OUTRO – LOW BEAT, VOCALS CENTERED, GATES\-STYLE DELIVERY\] \[Music fades into ambient bass, spoken word takes spotlight\]

They say I’m doin’ too much\.

But they ain’t felt this warmth\.

Ain’t held this weight\.

Ain’t looked in the eyes of two women who know what they bring and never apologize for takin’ up space\.

I ain’t weak for lovin’ ‘em—I’m wise\.

‘Cause when you stop starvin’ for validation,

you start feastin’ on what’s real\.

And this? This right here?

This is real\.

Same\. Damn\. Time\."

<a id="_opqoygxwv9w5"></a>Cradle Me, Pimp 

\[Spoken word: clear and articulate, slow and fierce drill beat\]

The streets will cradle you soft, and love you like a pimp,

They’ll hold you close, then dip out with a limp\.

\[Intro: Spoken, with playful bounce\]

In the streets so wide, where the lights don’t dim,

They cradle you soft, and love you like a pimp\.

It’s a world of tricks, and a world of games,

Where the love’s all sugar but the heart’s full of flames\!

\[Verse 1: Light, bouncy flow\]

I woke up today on a bright, sunny street,

With shoes on my feet, but no food to eat\.

The pavement’s my playground, the corner my bed,

Where dreams spin like tops, and the road’s full of dread\.

The people, they smile, but I know what’s real,

They’ll hug you with love, but it’s fake, that’s the deal\!

They’ll hold you tight, and whisper “You’re great\!”

But when you fall down, they’ll be runnin’ the race\.

\[Pre\-Chorus: Playful, sing\-songy\]

The streets will cradle you soft, love you like a pimp,

But they’ll flip on you quick, leave your soul feeling limp\.

They’ll hug you and kiss you, but watch out for the trick,

'Cause love from the street can get colder real quick\!

\[Chorus: Light and catchy\]

The streets will cradle you soft, and love you like a pimp,

They’ll hold you close, then dip out with a limp\.

They’ll love you deep, then leave you high and dry,

So be careful, my friend, don't believe the sweet lie\.

\[Verse 2: Faster, energetic, Seuss\-inspired\]

Oh the streets, they’re a wild and wiggly thing,

With a pop and a snap and a twist of a sling\!

They’ll throw you a hug, and pull out a string,

Then leave you out there, with no coat, no bling\!

They’ll smile real wide and say, "Come on in\!"

But watch for the trap, it’s where the games begin\!

You think they love you, you think it’s a thrill,

But they’ll grab your wallet, and leave you still\!

They say “We got your back,” but they really don’t,

They’ll love you today, then tomorrow—won’t\!

\[Pre\-Chorus: Playful, sing\-songy\]

The streets will cradle you soft, love you like a pimp,

But they’ll flip on you quick, leave your soul feeling limp\.

They’ll hug you and kiss you, but watch out for the trick,

'Cause love from the street can get colder real quick\!

\[Chorus: Light and catchy\]

The streets will cradle you soft, and love you like a pimp,

They’ll hold you close, then dip out with a limp\.

They’ll love you deep, then leave you high and dry,

So be careful, my friend, don't believe the sweet lie\.

\[Bridge: Playful, rhythmic\]

Cradle me, but don't cage me tight,

Love me, but don’t hold me all night\.

I know your tricks, your sweet little game,

But I’m not the fool you can always blame\!

I’ll rise like a kite, but I won’t fall for your bluff,

I’ll keep it movin’, stay strong, stay tough\!

\[Outro: Gentle, whimsical fade\-out\]

The streets cradled me soft, and loved me like a pimp,

But I learned their ways, and I’m no longer slim\.

I dance through the chaos, I glide with the flip,

The streets can’t fool me—I've mastered the grip\!

<a id="_aa9ia911bing"></a>Grit and GRACE

\[808’s hitting low setting rhythm\]

Grit \(grit\) GRIT AND \(GRIT\) AND 

\(GRIT AND GRACE\) GRIT AND GRACE\.

Grit \(grit\) GRIT AND \(GRIT\) AND 

\(GRIT AND GRACE\) GRIT AND GRACE\.

\[Dark, ambient music with a low, resonating hum\. Vocal tone: clear, conversational but rhythmic dominating soundscape\]

The city breathes in shadows, exhales the echoes of forgotten dreams\. Streets slick with rain mirror the fractured reflections of a world that demands perfection, yet offers only struggle\. We’ve all walked those streets, felt the chill of isolation, the weight of expectations that crush more than they uplift\. They tell you faith is a soft whisper, a gentle breeze in a field of daisies\. But out here, where the concrete bleeds and the sirens wail, faith is a clenched fist, a roar against the storm\. It’s the grit you find in the gutter, the grace you discover in the climb\. We’re not here for fairy tales or gilded lies\. We’re here for the raw, the real, the redemption found in the heart of the chaos\. I’m Ryan real A F, and this is Grit & Grace Church—a sanctuary for the outsiders, the hustlers, the survivors\. A place where we embrace the suck, where we find power in our pain, and where we trust in the filth to forge something unbreakable\. Welcome to the revolution of real faith\.

\[Intro: Spoken, raw delivery\]

Streets whisper tales of struggle, where shadows stretch and hope feels distant\. But in this chaos, a truth remains: faith ain’t found in comfort; it’s forged in the fire\. Welcome to Grit & Grace, where we find redemption in the raw\.

\[Verse 1: Gritty, steady flow\]

They tell you faith is soft, a whisper in the wind\.

But I say, faith is a fist, a fight to rise again\.

We ain’t here for fairytales, no gilded, sugarcoated lies\.

We embrace the suck, where real power truly lies\.

Scars mark the path, lessons etched in pain\.

But in this grit, a strength you can’t contain\.

\[Pre\-Chorus: Melodic, haunting echo\]

Feel the weight, the pressure, the crushing undertow\.

But even in the darkness, a flicker starts to glow\.

Grace ain’t a free pass, it’s a hand that pulls you through\.

When you’re lost in the shadows, it’s the light that sees you too\.

\[Hook: Chant\-like, layered vocals\]

In the filth we trust, in the struggle we rise\.

Grit and Grace collide, beneath these weary skies\.

Embrace the suck, let the pain refine\.

Redemption’s raw, where the sacred and the street align\.

\[Verse 2: Faster cadence, controlled chaos\]

They preach of perfection, a flawless, painted scene\.

But we know the truth, where the cracks reveal the queen\.

Or the king, the survivor, the warrior in the night\.

Turning pain into purpose, igniting inner light\.

No silver spoon salvation, no easy, hollow praise\.

We build our own damn kingdom, through these gritty, broken days\.

\[Bridge: Distorted, atmospheric breakdown\]

The beat distorts, the world spins out of sight\.

But in the chaos, a voice cuts through the night\.

“You ain’t defined by the struggle, but how you rise above\.”

A moment of clarity, a testament to love\.

\[Final Hook: Impactful, layered intensity\]

In the filth we trust, in the struggle we rise\.

Grit and Grace collide, beneath these weary skies\.

Embrace the suck, let the pain refine\.

Redemption’s raw, where the sacred and the street align\.

\[Outro: Reflective, fading echoes\]

The streets still whisper, the shadows still remain\.

But in our hearts, a fire, that no storm can ever tame\.

Grit and Grace, a legacy untold\.

A story of redemption, in a world grown cold\.

<a id="_dxlid3jqtiay"></a>Stand like me

Stand Like \(like\) Me,

Not for politicians\!

For the ones, \(the ones\),

Who fight to keep us free\.

\[Intro: Slow burn chant, subdued bass, spectral synths\]

\(Crowd murmurs: "Stand like me\! Stand like me\!"\)

Ayy\! This one for the real\!

For the ones who never kneel\!

No salute, no deal—just stand like me, keep it real\!

\[Hook: Slow, resonant chant, measured yet powerful delivery\]

This ain’t for show, nah, I ain't pretendin'\!

For the ones who ain't home, for the ones in the trenches\!

No pledge, no vows, we don’t need to agree,

You ain't gotta salute—just stand like me\!

\[Verse 1: Plodding 808s, introspective, deliberate flow\]

You got a badge, I got a record,

You in the books, I was out here reckless\!

Different paths, but we both in the fight,

You run toward it, I ran from the lights\!

I ain’t no puppet, I ain't no pawn,

Ain’t playin’ roles just to play along\!

I don’t wave flags, I don’t pick sides,

But real gon’ spot real when the sparks collide\!

\[Hook: Slow, resonant chant, measured yet powerful delivery\]

This ain’t for show, nah, I ain't pretendin'\!

For the ones who ain't home, for the ones in the trenches\!

No pledge, no vows, we don’t need to agree,

You ain't gotta salute—just stand like me\!

\[Verse 2: Deep, measured groove, heavy bass, deliberate verses\]

I done spent nights with my face on the floor,

Pulled gravel from my skin, shook it off like before\!

Was I mad? Nah, I played my hand,

Ain’t no cryin’ when you take the stand\!

Cops and soldiers, both in the field,

Most just tryna keep the shit real\.

We ain't the same, but the hustle aligned,

Respect ain't a paper, it's state of the mind\!

\[Bridge: Slow, call\-and\-response, deep 808 pulse\]

Ain’t ‘bout the news \(nah\!\), ain’t ‘bout the hype \(nah\!\)

It’s ‘bout the ones who ain’t make that flight\!

Some came home \(yeah\!\), some in the ground \(yeah\!\),

So I plant my feet, ten toes down\!

\[Hook: Slow, resonant chant, measured yet powerful delivery\]

This ain’t for show, nah, I ain't pretendin'\!

For the ones who ain't home, for the ones in the trenches\!

No pledge, no vows, we don’t need to agree,

You ain't gotta salute—just stand like me\!

\[Verse 3: Heavy, slow southern flow with layered introspection\]

I ain't no patriot wrapped in a flag,

But I seen real ones who ain’t make it back\!

Some died in war, some died in the streets,

Some wore fatigues, some ran with the heat\!

Every battle ain't fought overseas, nah,

Some wars fought where the dope fiends lean, nah\!

So if you feel me, then you know it’s true,

Respect ain't a stance, it’s just what you do\!

\[Hook – Outro: Slow, powerful call\-and\-response\]

This ain’t for show, nah, I ain't pretendin'\!

For the ones who ain't home, for the ones in the trenches\!

No pledge, no vows, we don’t need to agree,

You ain't gotta salute—just stand like me\!
