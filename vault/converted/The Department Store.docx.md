The Department Store 

\[bass male spoken word, robotic female cashier, and clownish mocking vocals cut sarcastic loops\]

You can’t bring your bags into the store, you must leave your bags at the front\.”

__\[Spoken Word Intro: articulate bass male vocal\]  
__ A department store frozen in dream logic\.  
 The reel keeps rewinding, same scene playing on loop\.  
 The cashier, dry and robotic, delivers her script:

__\[Spoken word: female cashier vocal\]  
__ “You can’t bring your bags into the store, you must leave your bags at the front\.”

__\[Spoken word: clownish male vocal, exaggerated mockery\]  
__ “With THAT guy?\!”

__\[Spoken word: articulate bass male vocal\]  
__ Security guard standing there, stiff, hollow—  
 man looks like he couldn’t fight his way out of a paper sack\.

The lady repeats, broken\-PA style:

__\[Spoken word: female cashier vocal\]  
__ “You can’t bring your bags into the store\.\.\.”

__\[Spoken word: clownish male vocal, exaggerated mockery\]  
__ “With THAT guy?\!”

__\[Spoken word: female cashier vocal\]  
__ “\.\.\.must leave your bags at the front\.”

__\[Spoken word: clownish male vocal, exaggerated mockery\]  
__ “With THAT guy?\!”

__\[Spoken word: articulate bass male vocal\]  
__ The loop keeps going,  
 like the whole building’s haunted by monotony\.  
 You look at the guard, cardboard badge shining under fluorescent lights,  
 and the thought hits again:

__\[Spoken word: clownish male vocal, exaggerated mockery, slower\]  
__ “With… that… guy?\!”

__\[Verse 1: bass male vocal\]  
__ Take a lap around the store’s perimeter\.  
 See the evidence scattered like breadcrumbs—  
 security tags littered everywhere,  
 proof the guard’s more prop than protector\.  
 He’s here to *look like authority,  
* but authority’s already been stripped, bagged, carried off\.

__\[Verse 2: bass male vocal\]  
__ Scene snaps, dream cuts\.  
 Now a hilltop at night\.  
 Two lovers wrapped in each other,  
 world’s noise drowned out by a chorus of crickets\.

__\[Spoken word: articulate bass male vocal, intimate tone\]  
__ “If you’re gonna ride with me, do what you please, just never lie to me\.”

That vow echoes like gospel\.  
 They sit still, admiring their haul,  
 not trophies but testimony—  
 trust heavier than any bag,  
 passion louder than alarms\.

__\[Chorus: bass male vocal, dramatic pause\]  
__ But wait…  
 those aren’t crickets\.

That sound?  
 That’s a garbage bag of security tags,  
 rustling like nature’s own choir\.

Clink by clink,  
 they sing a metallic lullaby,  
 proving love doesn’t need receipts\.

__\[Verse 3: bass male vocal\]  
__ Then the reel jerks,  
 and you’re yanked back under fluorescent lights\.  
 Cashier stuck on loop,  
 guard frozen like a crash\-test dummy\.

__\[Spoken word: female cashier vocal\]  
__ “You can’t bring your bags into the store,  
 you must leave your bags at the front\.”

__\[Spoken word: clownish male vocal, exaggerated mockery\]  
__ “With THAT guy?\!”

The joke lands sharper now\.  
 Because out there—on the hilltop, under moonlight—  
 love guarded something stronger than assets\.  
 And in here?  
 They’re asking you to hand your soul over…  
 to *that guy*
