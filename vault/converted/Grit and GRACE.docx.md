# Grit and GRACE

__Music Direction:__ Industrial Rock meets Orchestral, blending distorted guitars with a full string section\.

\[Intro: Heavy industrial drone | ad\-libs: "The friction\.\.\. and the flow\."\] Dirt under the nails, silk on the skin\. The battle outside and the quiet within\.

\[Verse 1: Intense, breathy delivery | ad\-libs: "Push through," "Find the center"\] The concrete is hard but the water is deep\. Promises made that I’m struggling to keep\. Grinding the gears just to find the rhythm\. Living in the cage but I am the prism\.

\[Pre\-Hook: Strings take over the melody | ad\-libs: "Elevate"\] The grit is the foundation, the grace is the tower\. Combining the struggle to find the power\.

\[Hook: Powerful, anthemic swell | ad\-libs: "Hold on," "Grit and Grace"\] Grit for the climb, Grace for the fall\. I’m standing upright through it all\. Grit in the heart, Grace in the soul\. The pieces are broken but the spirit is whole\.

\[Outro: Spoken, tone: inspired and calm\] You need the pressure to make the diamond\. \[Sound cue: Orchestral crescendo followed by a single piano note\]
