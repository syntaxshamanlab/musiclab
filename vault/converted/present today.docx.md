Present today, just you and me\.

No worries about tomorrow, you see\.

Leave betrayal and lies behind,

Let our human sides unwind\.

You're free to deceive the world around, 

Leave a scandalous trail, let chaos abound\. 

A million in your wake, if that's what it takes 

When you look at me don't be fake, cause we got to much at stake

In the memory of those who played the game,

I hear their teardrops fall like rain\.

I'm down to chill, for a day, week, year, 

But let's be clear\! no time for games here\.

I ain't a Gameboy\! don't play pretend\.

I'll vibe with you if you're keeping it 100, my friend\.

Too old for wasting time on deceit\.

In the streets, honesty's a rare feat\.

I know what I want, no compromise\!

Provide a safe space, where truth never dies\.

Air your transgressions, don't be shady as fuck\!

In this realness, find the trust we construct\.

If you mess up, just tell me straight\.

I won't mind, even if it's a heavyweight\.

But lie, deceive, or try to hide\.

Trust is lost, in the shadows it'll hide\.

Love's foundation is built on this,

Honesty and communication, not a bliss\!

When trust is lost, love can't survive,

So let's be open, real, side by side\.

Present today, no room for games\.

Footsteps echo, in life's delicate frames\.

Let our love grow, wild and free\.

In this reality, just you and me\.
