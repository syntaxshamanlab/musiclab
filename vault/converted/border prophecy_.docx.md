\[Minimalist beat, ambient and eerie—like wind in ruins\. Vocals sharp, deliberate, Shakespearean cadence with street grit\. Every word lands like a spell or strike\]

We don't run,

We Run Shit\.

The Border adventures, 

A Darkened Prophecy\.

\[Verse 1: Rhythmic, dusk\-lit pacing\] So there I lay, soul weary beneath neon's hum, A pilgrim by the 7\-Eleven’s gate, where the night spoke in static\. One in the morn, eyes heavy, limbs like stone, Then—like fate summoned in heels—two femmes arrive\.

"You got juice?" one asks, fire in her laugh\. A nod, a cord, and a glow\. We spark up, Smoke curling like incense in a street\-born cathedral\. A track plays low—gospel of the gutter\.

Then, without pause, they ask, "You ridin'?" I rise—not with question, but knowing\. “Let’s go\.”

They write laws\. We bend space\.

We move with ghosts, we set the pace\.

\[Verse 2: Swagger rising, tension coiled\] Not your average muses—nah\. One named Star, loud like sirens, hips preaching\. Her flame? Unashamed\. Other one? Call her Lex\. Silent, sleek, scent of chess and danger\. She ain’t talk much—but the world listened\.

They took me south—to the border’s mouth\. Night alive, food court buzzin’, music grooving\. We post up like legends unrecognized\.

Security tries to flex\. Star don’t blink\. “You forget we know where you sleep in TJ, fool?” She hurls heat like a warlock in heels\. Guard fades like a bad memory\. Lex leans close, lips barely part\.

“We run it\.”

They write laws\. We bend space\.

We move with ghosts, we set the pace\.

\[Verse 3: Dreamlike, gritty confidence\] Later—I need the head, but I’m trapped in the booth, Boxed in like a pawn at the board’s edge\. So I rise—no shame, no sorry, Walk the damn table in the next booth over\. Cups crash, plates scatter\. I drop down clean\. “We run it,” I smirk\.

The world was bending around us, Like time knew who to bow to\.

They write laws\. We bend space\.

We move with ghosts, we set the pace\.

\[Verse 4: Morning\-after magic, cold moves\] Sun up\. We scoop a stray dude on the way\. He and Star slip inside some department store\. Lex and I? We stay, watching bags like thrones\. Uber pulls up—clock ticking\. Star and the stray still lost in fabric and perfume\.

So we bounce\. Just us\. Just right\.

Try the same motel\. Gatekeeper ain’t feelin’ us\. Says our saga’s too loud for repeat business\. I step up, flash that grin soaked in hood scripture\. Speak soft\. Mean hard\.

He folds\. We enter\.

\[Verse 5: Quiet thunder, aftermath\] Room hums like prophecy fulfilled\. Lex, in the hush, reaches\. Fingertips trace the story carved in my palms\. Whispers: “Didn’t think your hands would feel this\.\.\. right\.”

A pause thick as scripture\. No halos\. No lies\. Just gravity\.

They write laws\. We bend space\.

We move with ghosts, we set the pace\.
