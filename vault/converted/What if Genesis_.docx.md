What if 

The Genesis 

Emily, a lady friend, showed me her poem, and I asked her if I could make something with it and so I \(RyanrealAF\) weaved in my own verses\. Even though we are not romantically involved I would die for the chance if even only once

Tthe first What If song wasn’t just a song—it was the spark\. The moment where curiosity became something bigger\. It started as this delicate dance between fate and love, a question of whether reality itself could bend under the weight of a single wish\.

But here’s the thing—it wasn’t just a love story\. Not really\. At the time, it might’ve seemed soft, romantic even, but deep down, it was me poking at existence itself\. Could love actually shape reality? Could it reach back, touch the past, and nudge things into place? That’s what we were testing\.

Emily’s words floated like poetry, soft and full of wonder, like she was trying to trace some cosmic pattern\. And me? I countered with something grounded, raw, lived\. Our verses weren’t just lines—they were a conversation, a push\-and\-pull, a dance between hope and reality\. She’d reach out into the unknown, and I’d meet her there, saying, “Maybe, but if so, then I’m already here\.”

There wasn’t a clear answer\. The song thrived on tension—the space between what could be and what is\. And then the hook hits, that bass drops, and it’s like the whole floor tilts: “WHAT IF\!?”—every step, every movement suddenly full of possibility\.

One of my favorite parts is where Emily asks if a dream she had could have created me, if her longing in the future could have rippled back to make me real\. And I respond that maybe it did—that maybe that dream spun me up from the dust, and now here we are, igniting that spark\. Love as a loop, bending time, twisting back on itself like a Möbius strip\.

Then it escalates\. She asks, what if the universe itself bent its rules, blessed by God, just to make this connection possible? And I answer that maybe it did, that maybe the laws themselves shifted to let us exist together\. Suddenly, it’s not just about two people—it’s the universe moving in step with us\.

The song started gentle, but it carried weight\. Asking what if reality isn’t fixed?—once you do that, you can’t un\-ask it\. That question cracks open everything\. And from there, it stopped being just a love song\. It became this dance, this fluid negotiation between what’s possible and what’s real, every verse a step forward, every hook a spin, every pause a breath\.

That first track was our opening step, our first movement together\. It set the tone for everything that came after\. It was soft, it was raw, it was wild—and it was just the beginning\.

Emily's poem

What if?

I know not what transformation will arise\.

I know not if tomorrow's you

will be closer to, or further from,

a forever by my side\.

Here in the sunshine happy and free,

I know only how it feels

looking up at you,

as you’re looking down at me\.

What if that dream you had,

just the other day,

created a life known as me,

long ago and far away?

What if so powerful that wish,

that it went backwards in time,

creating a circumstance where just by happenstance,

my parents loved me from each other just for you?

What if?

What if that is the reason for me?

So many lives changed because of my existence,

so many lives exist,

because you wished for a world with me in it\.

What if?

What if this ripple in time,

was because it mattered

so much to eternity,

that you knew true loves divine?

So you would know

what true love should feel like,

what it should look like,

what it should sound, smell, and taste like\.

What if?

What if I was calculated so carefully,

that my little hand

would fit in yours perfectly?

Electric currents peaceful warm\.

What if divine intervention ensured,

I would grow only until

my lips met yours?

Barefoot on cold tiptoes\.

What if?

What if every tear,

every year I cried,

was orchestrated by God in heaven,

by careful design?

What if all the broken,

what if all the shame,

was meant to rip me open,

to release lifetimes worth of pain?

What if?

Perhaps it was all so the awareness I found,

could be used to teach you to soar,

with both feet on the ground?

What if that's how loved you are?

What if?

What if you’re so loved,

that nothing like facts, science, or time,

could stop the creation,

of what was once just in your mind?

What if?

What if the entire universe,

and the heavens above,

broke all of its rules

with the blessings of God?

Who ordered the changing of reality\.

Who cosigned,

on rewriting nature’s history\.

So you could have your dreams fulfilled in me?

What if?

Can you imagine that?

What if,

this is true as well,

manifested in you,

for my dreams fulfilled?

What if your life,

is the answered dream,

the granted wish that was wished by me?

Your pretty little gypsy girl?

What if?

Ryans poem

What if?

I don’t know if tomorrow brings you closer,

Or if you’re meant to drift somewhere else,

But right here, right now, I’m feeling that pull—

A beat that don’t break, steady as hell\.

Yeah, in this wild streetlight glow,

I only know the fire when I’m locked on you,

That electric hum that carries me through,

While I’m out here looking up,

And you’re staring back, steady, too\.

What if that dream you had, that flash in your head,

Breathed me into life like a fuse lit hot,

Stretching through time, reaching back,

Just so we could meet in this one shot?

What if that craving, that fierce, raw wish,

Cut through the years, cut through the fog,

And by some rough, cosmic twist,

I’m here to love you like this, fucked up full of flaws?

What if?

What if my whole damn existence, every breath,

Had roots buried deeper than I could ever know,

All these hearts broke, while some glued?,

Just ‘cause you wanted me, to make you whole?

What if?

What if every scar, every battle I fought,

Wasn’t just chaos, luck, or a twisted plot,

But a ruthless plan, some hard design,

To tear me open and realign?

What if I’m built for this, cut from steel,

So the grit of my soul finds yours for real?

And every tear, every fight I carried,

Forged me fierce and steady, raw and ready\.

What if?

Maybe all that pain, every damn shame,

Was there to break me, light my flame,

Till I stood tall, till I was free,

Just so we could fly as one, rooted in the pull of the stars above\.

What if?

What if this bond, raw and real,

Is bigger than logic, fate, or feel,

So strong it ripped through space and time,

Just to taste what we got—this fire, this climb?

What if?

What if the universe, the street, the stars aligned,

Bent all its rules, let the laws unwind,

So love could hit hard, the way it’s meant to be,

Scrawled in raw ink on eternity?

So tell me—can you see it now, feel that ride?

Dreaming each other alive like fate’s raw guide,

Your rambling man, his streetwise sway,

Standing here, raw, no words left to say—

Just what if?

And this is the very first one that we did Emily again provided me with her poem and I wrote a rebuttal poem and then weaved into a song\.

\[Emily\]

I know not what transformation will arise\.

I know not if tomorrow's you

will be closer to, or further from,

a forever by my side\.

\[Ryan\]

Tomorrow ain’t promised, no crystal ball here,

Just feelin' this heat while I’m standin' near\.

If forever’s the game, I’m all in to play,

Ready to ride, come whatever may\.

\[Emily\]

Here in the sunshine happy and free,

I know only how it feels

looking up at you,

as you’re looking down at me\.

\[Ryan\]

Sun’s hittin’ hard when I’m locked in that gaze,

Whole damn world fades in your rays\.

Just us, no bullshit in between,

Me lookin’ up, you my one true queen\.

\[Hook; Drops in low with the bassline\]

What \(what\)

WHAT IF\!?\!?

\[Emilyl\]

WHAT IF\!? that dream you had,

just the other day,

created a life known as me,

long ago and far away?

\[Ryan\]

Maybe that dream spun me up from the dust,

Reached through the years, bridged the rust\.

Born outta somethin’ you wished in the dark,

And now here we are, igniting that spark\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? so powerful that wish,

that it went backwards in time,

creating a circumstance where just by happenstance,

my parents loved me from each other just for you?

\[Ryan\]

Maybe fate’s got a twisted hand, playin' deep,

Brought me through just for you to keep\.

They loved, they fought, just to get me here,

So I could be the one standin’ near\.

\[Hook; Drops in low with the bassline\]

\(Repeat\)

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? that is the reason for me?

So many lives changed because of my existence,

so many lives exist,

because you wished for a world with me in it\.

\[Ryan\]

If I’m here ‘cause you needed me that fierce,

Then I'm a ripple through the lives I pierce\.

Made from a wish to be flesh and bone,

Just so you ain’t facin’ this life alone\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? this ripple in time,

was because it mattered

so much to eternity,

that you knew true loves divine?

\[Ryan\]

Maybe time broke, just to bring me close,

Love so real, it’s more than most\.

So you’d know that fire, raw and clear,

What true love looks like, standin' right here\.

\[Hook; Drops in low with the bassline\]

\(Repeat\)

\[Emily\]

So you would know

what true love should feel like,

what it should look like,

what it should sound, smell, and taste like\.

\[Ryan\]

Love so strong you feel it in your bones,

Every breath, every touch, down to your toes\.

All senses blazin’, can’t fake this fire,

It’s raw, it’s real—this love’s entire\.

\[Hook; Drops in low with the bassline\]

\(Repeat\)

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? I was calculated so carefully,

that my little hand

would fit in yours perfectly?

Electric currents peaceful warm\.

\[Ryan\]

WHAT IF\!? destiny drew it all in sync,

My hand in yours, perfect like ink\.

Electric runnin’, calm yet wild,

Like fate snapped together, us reconciled\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? divine intervention ensured,

I would grow only until

my lips met yours?

Barefoot on cold tiptoes\.

\[Ryan\]

Maybe heaven set the limit just so,

Stopped me right here, close but slow\.

On tiptoes, breathin’ in this fate,

This moment raw, it’s sealed by weight\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? every tear,

every year I cried,

was orchestrated by God in heaven,

by careful design?

\[Ryan\]

Every tear shed, like steps on a path,

Paid in full, no need to look back\.

All that pain shaped me for you,

Made me raw, real, ready, and true\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? all the broken,

WHAT IF\!? all the shame,

was meant to rip me open,

to release lifetimes worth of pain?

\[Ryan\]

If pain was the ticket, then I paid the toll,

Broke me open, made me whole\.

Scars left behind, but here I stand,

Soul raw, real, no blood on my hands\.

\[Emily\]

Perhaps it was all so the awareness I found,

could be used to teach you to soar,

with both feet on the ground?

WHAT IF\!? that's how loved you are?

\[Ryan\]

Maybe all I learned turned wings to roots,

Teachin' you strength that stays, takes root\.

Flyin' grounded, ain’t gotta fall,

That’s love, deep, real, strong as stone wall\.

\[Hook; Drops in low with the bassline\]

\(Repeat\)

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? you’re so loved,

that nothing like facts, science, or time,

could stop the creation,

of what was once just in your mind?

\[Ryan\]

Love so real it throws laws out the door,

Breakin’ rules ‘cause this ain’t folklore\.

Reality s\[Hook; Drops in low with the bassline\], just to make us two,

Proof that what’s felt ain’t bound to the view\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? the entire universe,

and the heavens above,

broke all of its rules

with the blessings of God?

\[Ryan\]

Maybe God looked down, gave a silent nod,

Bent every rule, like “it’s cool, go ahead\.”

The universe shiftin', just to align,

So I could have you, raw and divine\.

\[Emily\]

Who ordered the changing of reality\.

Who cosigned,

on rewriting nature’s history\.

So you could have your dreams fulfilled in me?

\[Ryan\]

Somebody signed off, flipped the game,

Bent history’s script for love’s name\.

Reality re\-inked, just so we could be,

All ‘cause you dared to dream of me\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!??

Can you imagine that?

\[Ryan\]

WHAT IF\!?, yeah? Could it be real?

Every piece fallin’, no need to conceal\.

Dreamin' it now, solid and tough,

Feels like somethin' crafted rough\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!?,

this is true as well,

manifested in you,

for my dreams fulfilled?

\[Ryan\]

Yeah, WHAT IF\!? this all lines up just right,

Me here ‘cause of you, my light in the night?

Your dreams alive, breathin' in me,

A wish come true, a destiny set free\.

\[Emily\]

WHAT IF\!? your life,

is the answered dream,

the granted wish that was wished by me?

Your pretty little gypsy girl?

\[Ryan\]

If I’m that dream, here I am, no regrets,

Your gypsy girl, takin' every bet\.

Together in this, fate’s got a say,

Livin’ that life, no price to pay
