\[Tone: Dark, Cinematic, Dominant Female Vocal\]

Ladies and Gentlemen I present to you,

Ashley and Ravens, night to remember\.

\[Intro: Spoken with fire, no background music\]

She roared like thunder, vanished in vain—while goddesses danced in the midnight rain\.

\[Verse 1: Confident, gritty tone\]

Second time out, gates still echo my name

Disturbed concert—frontline, back in the game

Shorty by my side, barely a hundred ten

Name don’t matter, she ain’t make it to the end

Line long, mood charged, war drum in the crowd

One chick walks past, calls her out loud

“Slut”—said it slick with venom in her breath

Lil’ thing turned, like she summoned her own death

No pause, no talk, no flex—just bang

Pounced on that chick like a wolf off the chain

Crowd went wild, fists, hair, pure rage

But me? I slipped solo, front\-row to backstage

\[Refrain 1: Dominant delivery, mocking tone\]

She roared like thunder, vanished in vain—while goddesses danced in the midnight rain\.

Thought she was fire, thought she was flame—couldn’t handle the storm, just played the game\.

\[Verse 2: Pacing like a predator, smooth menace\]

Barstool throne, sippin' still, eyein' the scene

Then two queens glide by—gothic and mean

Laced in black, curves that commanded the space

Girdles, skirts, dark lips on full display

Caught me staring, they spun on a dime

Posted up, one each side—perfect crime

Ashley on the right, mouth like a blade

Said, “Raven thinks we should take you and slay”

I laughed, “Bet,” like I meant it right then

They said, “Drop your number, we’ll hit you again”

Two weeks passed—I forgot that night

Then they call: “You off work? Cool\. We ride\.”

\[Refrain 2: Smoky, powerful tone, rising tension\]

While she played braveheart and lost her claim—two heavy\-hitter queens lit a whole new flame\.

When the pretty ones flee, the real ones remain—dancing with shadows, dripping in game\.

\[Verse 3: Detailed, cinematic, voice unwavering\]

Walk in they crib, and the walls got voice

Full murals of them—no shame, no choice

Woods, blood, showers, erotic pain

Ashley licking crimson like it's part of the rain

I said, “What the—” but stepped in deeper

Backroom vibe: predator meets reaper

Whips, cuffs, wax, ice, control

Feather to flame, they swallowed me whole

Handcuffed tight, heartbeat fast

Switchin' roles—pain then a sensual blast

Raven on the left, Ashley in command

Queens of power play, grip like brands

\[Refrain 3: Celebratory, unapologetic power\]

She roared like thunder, vanished in vain—while goddesses danced in the midnight rain\.

These big girls don’t beg, they reign—discipline and pleasure, tangled in chains\.

\[Verse 4: Slower build, dominant vibe remains\]

I ain’t submissive, I don’t fold, don’t bow

But that mix of hurt and heaven? Yeah, I allow

Taught me a lesson ‘bout trust and thrill

That size ain't weakness—it's depth, it's will

Goth chicks knew how to ride the flame

Own their bodies, own the game

While that dime\-piece faded, scared of play

These goddesses owned the whole damn stage

\[Refrain 4: Triumphant, end with punch\]

She roared like thunder, vanished in vain—while goddesses danced in the midnight rain\.

She dipped out scared, missed the campaign—Ashley and Raven? They carved their name\.

\[Outro: Spoken, over faint ambient pulse\]

Ain’t always the pretty ones who leave a mark\.\.\.

It’s the wild ones in the dark—

The queens who bring the spark\.
