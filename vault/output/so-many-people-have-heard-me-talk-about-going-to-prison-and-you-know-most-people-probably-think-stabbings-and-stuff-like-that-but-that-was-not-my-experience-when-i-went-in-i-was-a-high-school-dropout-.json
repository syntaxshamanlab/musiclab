    "title": "So many people have heard me talk about going to prison and, you know, most people probably think stabbings and stuff like that, but that was not my experience\\. When I went in, I was a high school dropout\\. I didn't have my GED, so I was forced to go to the GED platform\\. And the teacher initially said, well, let's run some, let's test you out and see what happens\\. And so I took the math test, the pre\\-test, and I missed one\\. I was like, how the fuck is that possible? Because I told my math, I was in remedial math, and I told the teacher to go F himself all the time\\. So I was like, how the hell am I missing one? Awesome\\. And so I took the math test, the GD test, Again, I missed one\\. And so then it was like, okay, English is my   hard subject, the one I thought I would really struggle at\\. And so I'm just gonna focus on just getting the essay right and things like that\\. And I just ended up just testing out on all the tests\\. Boom\\. Long story short, the teacher asked me to be his tutor because his tutor was leaving\\. And Most tutors in prison are, they just sit there and basically do nothing, play on the computer, assist the teacher in whatever she needs done\\. But really, even most teachers are burnt out, and they don't even do anything\\. They just take roll, make sure everybody's there, and that's about it\\. They don't really get active\\. And so, the first time was I mean, it was cool participating, but I didn't really get my groove\\. It wasn't until the second time that I got to work\\. I  went in for an interview for Tudor Spot, and I was up against guys that were teachers on the streets and things like that, people that were really educated, that could score way better than me on any test\\. We took the test, and when the teacher was talking to me, I told her, I said, yeah, these guys, I'm sure that they passed, I'm sure that they did way better than me on this test, but they don't speak the guy's language\\. I do, you know? And she was getting ready to retire\\. It was her last year\\. I asked her if I could really fucking, really like get in there and really fucking like to lecture and things like that\\. And she totally let me have free reign over the class\\. You know, at first the guys were like, F you, you know, you're not the fucking police\\. I'm like, Yeah, I know\\. I'm not the police\\. I'm one of you\\. We're the same\\. But I know a few tricks to where you can get it\\. You don't want to be in this class\\. Yeah, I get it\\. So then just take the test and be done\\. Just get it done\\. Then you don't have to worry about it\\. And he's like, most people would be like, how the fuck are you? Nobody's gonna hire me, dude\\. I got fucking tattoos all over my face\\. Nobody's gonna fucking hire me\\. I'm like, so, okay, so nobody's gonna hire you\\. So go to school then\\. Like you could be a career fucking college student\\. And you know, there's all kinds of options\\. You don't have to go to work\\. Anyways, you know, the teachers would like, they would try to like get people to start from decimals and work all the way up\\. I'm like, fuck that\\. No, just get them to where they can pass the test\\. That's all that really matters\\. Just get them to pass the test\\. That's all that matters\\. If they suck at fractions, if they can't get fractions, then fuck fractions\\. Focus on other shit\\. You know, if you, if you guess, if you guess on it's so they're multiple choice, you get four options\\. Two of them are totally fucking wrong, right? There's obviously they're way wrong\\. So if you just, just go off that alone, you got a 50, 50 chance of being right\\. Even if you just guess\\. And so that's what I tell the guys, I'd be like, just do just two of them are way fucking wrong\\. So then if you just go based off that, boom, you got a 50 50 chance of being right, even if you guess so that's pretty good odds\\. And so you know, I'd be like, if you suck at fractions, fine, guess guess all through fractions, just burn them out\\. Don't even try\\. Don't even waste your time\\. Focus on other shit, just getting all the other ones right\\. And anyways, we like got a shit ton of people got their GDs\\. Anyways, it was in that moment when I like fell in love with learning and I really realized like, every textbook that I could get my hands on, it's like I'm diving into it\\. And learning ended up being a really cool thing\\. It was really it was like, I don't need a fucking teacher, right? All I need is a damn book\\. And somebody that I can rely on to ask a few questions here and there\\. That's it\\. So it was pretty fucking wild, actually\\. The crazy thing is the teacher would have me do a private reading with this guy\\. This dude was like Paul Bunyan, lumberjack and motherfucker, beard, big old bill bit your belly everything but he couldn't read a lick not like couldn't read anything but it was the coolest thing watching this guy like humble himself and literally sit there and help me help him with the book and he would have like the kids books where it was like a picture and then one sentence on another one page was a picture and one page was one sentence and he'd be trying to guess it he'd be looking at the page picture and trying to guess it And I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no guessing\\. Sound, you know, sound it out\\. And, uh, it was just so cool watching him, like big old, huge lumberjack and motherfucker, you know, being able to humble himself\\. That was really cool\\. You know, and the homies would have maybe the old timer, the old timer Paisa dude, he couldn't speak no English\\. And so they'd have me help him, you know, at night and we'd do, little ESL, English as a Second Language\\. I didn't know no Spanish, but we had a book\\. And so we just went through the book together\\. It's super simple\\. And they paid me commissary for it\\. It was cool\\. But that was my prison experience, not stabbings and shit like that\\. I was a teacher every single time\\. Even if, like the last time I was in, the teacher said, Yeah, I got a tutor in that he's, you know, he's got 10 years left to do\\. There's, you know, I'm like, they only get one tutor for, you know, and so I'm like, okay, well, what if I get you another spot? Can I have it? She's like, good luck\\. I've had one tutor this entire time I've worked here\\. I've been here, you know, for 30 years\\. All right, but if I get it, I can have it, right? If I get you another spot, I can have it\\. And so I wrote the dean and I made my case to why the teacher should have two tutors, not just one\\. And guess what? She got another tutor spot\\. And so did every other teacher at that institution\\.",
